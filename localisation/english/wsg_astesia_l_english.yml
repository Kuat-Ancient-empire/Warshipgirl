 wg_astesia.2.title:"Asteraxis's Escape"
 wg_astesia.2.desc:"During a routine maintenance check, Asteraxis requested certain supplies, claiming they were needed for comprehensive repairs, and asked our researchers to temporarily vacate. Shortly afterward, Asteraxis activated its Jump Drive. At the same time, the transmission channel between us was unilaterally severed.\nIntelligence reports indicate we cannot reverse-engineer Asteraxis's jump coordinates-this was clearly a premeditated operation."
 wg_astesia.2.a:"Damn it. Let it pray we never meet again."

 wg_astesia_backstory:"Star Polar, an astronomer from the distant World of Terra, has journeyed through time and space to finally find you.\n\nAt both ends of the astronomical telescope lie the brightest stars in existence."

 wg_astesia.5.desc.1:"The hub is in good condition, thank you for your concern, Admiral."
 wg_astesia.5.desc.2:"The Jump Drive seems to have a minor malfunction. Don't worry-repair drones are already on it."
 wg_astesia.5.desc.3:"Perhaps I should add more research modules? Hmm... but I don't think there's space left."
 wg_astesia.5.desc.4:"Let me see, the placement of facilities... Hmm, no issues. It won't attract anything strange."
 wg_astesia.5.a:"Hmm."


 wg_astesia.100.title:"Silent Star Polar"
 wg_astesia.100.desc:"It has been one year since we successfully restored Star Polar. During this time, her contributions to the Empire's scientific advancement have been undeniable. However, according to reports from fellow researchers, aside from essential scientific work, Star Polar rarely interacts with others. More often, she sits quietly atop the observatory, gazing silently at the stars.\n\nA new option has been unlocked in the Star Polar communication interface: §HGo visit Star Polar§!"
 wg_astesia.100.a:"Perhaps we should go check on Miss Star Polar."
 wg_astesia.100.a.desc:"New option unlocked in the communication interface: §HGo visit Star Polar§!"
 wg_astesia.100.b:"§RMaybe it's better not to disturb her.§!"
 wg_astesia.100.b.desc:"§REnd Star Polar event chain.§!"

 wg_astesia.101.title:"Visit Star Polar"
 wg_astesia.101.desc:"You arrive at the research hub where Star Polar resides. The Empire's scientists warmly welcome your presence. Amid their enthusiastic company, you begin a tour to learn about current research progress.\nAfter the formalities conclude, you hesitate to directly contact Star Polar and spend considerable time searching-yet still cannot locate her familiar blue hologram.\nAs time passes, you grow slightly anxious. At that moment, a passing researcher suggests checking the top-level observatory-Miss Star Polar might be there."
 wg_astesia.101.a:"Proceed Immediately"
 wg_astesia.102.desc:"You take the elevator to the observatory atop the research hub. Around you, precision astronomical instruments are arranged with meticulous care.\nCarefully avoiding the equipment, you walk forward. At last, beneath the central colossal telescope, you find the familiar young girl.\nStarlight gently streams through the transparent dome above. The blue-haired girl sits sideways beside the telescope, silently gazing into the cosmos.\nUnwilling to break the tranquility, you stand quietly behind her. Together, you bathe under the starry sky, feeling the Profundum and depth of deep space.\n\"...Admiral?\"\nSnapping out of your daze, you realize Star Polar has turned around, quietly looking at you.\nYou smile softly and sit beside her."
 wg_astesia.102.a:"Have you been adapting well to life here? Any difficulties or discomforts?"
 wg_astesia.103.desc:"\"No, everyone here treats me kindly, both in daily life and work...\"\nStar Polar hesitates, turning to look at you.\nYou sense unease hidden deep within her heart. You pause, watching her quietly, waiting for her response.\nEncouraged by your gentle gaze, after a long hesitation, she timidly says: \"I'm a little afraid...\""
 wg_astesia.103.a:"What's wrong?"
 wg_astesia.104.desc:"Star Polar lowers her head. \"Learning and researching together with everyone is truly joyful, but I can't help thinking back to Endodia. Back then, everyone worked just as hard toward a shared goal-but in the end, they all...\"\nStar Polar falls silent, tears glistening in her eyes."
 wg_astesia.104.a:"It's all in the past now."
 wg_astesia.105.desc:"Star Polar remains silent. In the face of such profound sorrow, your carefully chosen words feel utterly powerless.\nYou open your mouth, trying to say something to ease the tension, but Star Polar interrupts, asking to be alone for a while.\nRespecting her wish, you quietly leave this starlit place."
 wg_astesia.105.a:"That's not ideal. We should visit and talk with her more often."

 wg_astesia.106.title:"Concern for Star Polar"
 wg_astesia.106.desc:"Since that incident, you've privately discussed Star Polar's condition multiple times with several Imperial psychologists. After learning about potential consequences, your concern for Star Polar has deepened significantly."
 wg_astesia.106.a:"It's time to act"
 wg_astesia.106.a.desc:"The 'Go visit Star Polar' option in the communication interface is now available.\n§YNote: Visits must be spaced four months apart.§!"

 wg_astesia.107.desc:"You and Star Polar arrive at the biological laboratory, which houses exotic creatures from various Worlds. Some are enormous and terrifying, others small and docile. As you walk, Star Polar explains each species beside you.\nDuring the tour, a green, bread-like circular organism on a lab table catches your eye. The creature curls into a ball, appearing unexpectedly cute. A nearby display indicates it has been sedated.\nYou pick it up-it feels surprisingly warm."
 wg_astesia.107.a:"Star Polar, what is this?"
 wg_astesia.108.desc:"Hearing your voice, Star Polar turns-and immediately turns pale with shock, urgently telling you to throw it away. But it's too late. In an instant, the creature violently inflates, radiating intense heat before exploding with a loud bang, leaving you covered in black soot.\nSeeing your soot-covered appearance, Star Polar can't help but laugh. Yet she quickly composes herself, sternly lecturing you for violating lab regulations."
 wg_astesia.108.a:"Erm... where's a towel?"
 wg_astesia.108.a.desc:"Starjey's affection has increased"
 wg_astesia.110.desc:"You arrive at the Empire's physics research institute. Upon entering, you see a massive particle collider. There, Star Polar is working alongside several scientists, conducting tests and collecting data. Seeing them so busy, you quietly sit aside without disturbing them. At work, Star Polar appears far more capable than usual-she skillfully operates the machinery, so engrossed she forgets to maintain her holographic projection. Watching machines operate seamlessly through her stationary hologram creates an oddly humorous scene.\nAfter a long while, upon finishing her work, Star Polar finally notices you in the corner. She quickly saves her data and repositions her hologram beside you.\n\"Ah, when did you arrive, Admiral? Would you like to see the experimental data?\""
 wg_astesia.110.a:"Take the display panel"
 wg_astesia.111.desc:"Seeing you struggling to appear deeply engaged with the data, Star Polar smiles helplessly, takes back the display panel, and patiently explains the meaning of each value..."
 wg_astesia.111.a:"Intelligence +10"
 wg_astesia.111.a.desc:"Starjey's affection has increased"
 wg_astesia.113.desc:"You have arrived at the most core area of the research hub: the Engineering Research Institute.\nIt doesn't feel like a laboratory meant for research, but rather resembles a massive factory. Various machines operate with constant rumbling sounds. A large number of auxiliary drones move orderly through every gap and corridor, transporting supplies in batches-an impressive scene.\nAt this moment, a seemingly familiar robot production line catches your attention.\n\"Ah, this is the production line where I manufacture my own robots. All the robots under my control are built right here,\" Starjey explains beside you, her figure through among the streams of drones."
 wg_astesia.113.a:"Starjey... is there any way for you to regain a physical body?"
 wg_astesia.114.desc:"The girl's holographic projection suddenly stops, and you see it trembling slightly.\n\"This... for now, I... let's just forget about it.\"\nStarjey's expression turns somewhat despondent"
 wg_astesia.114.a:"You wisely choose not to bring up the topic again, silently pondering something in your mind"
 wg_astesia.114.a.desc:"Starjey's affection has increased"

 wg_astesia.115.title:"Starjey's Invitation"
 wg_astesia.115.desc:"Today, upon arriving at the Admiral's office, you suddenly received an //email// inviting you to the observatory, signed by Starjey."
 wg_astesia.115.a:"Go willingly"
 wg_astesia.116.desc:"You arrive at the observatory on time. The vast observatory is completely empty. Starjey waves to you, beckoning you over.\nStanding before her, Starjey turns off all the lighting equipment one by one, then says to you:\n\"Admiral, would you like to try astrology?\""
 wg_astesia.116.a:"Astrology? Isn't that pseudoscience?"
 wg_astesia.117.desc:"\"Admiral, do you know-I'm actually not an Endordian... Though memories from before are nearly gone, some strange abilities remain-similar to psionic powers, yet different. Even in this state, I can still use them. I call it astrology.\"\n\"Admiral, would you like to give it a try?\" Starjey's eyes sparkle with anticipation."
 wg_astesia.117.a:"You reach out your hand, closing your eyes as Starjey instructed."
 wg_astesia.118.desc:"In the darkness, a faint bluish glow gradually appears. Then, stars emerge around you. Instinctively, you walk forward-one World after another materializes before you, only to vanish instantly.\nDeep down, you feel a yearning for something, driving you onward. You witness dazzling supernovae, deep and terrifying Black Holes, and even many bizarre, indescribable phenomena.\nEventually, everything fades behind you. In the endless darkness, only a slender ribbon of soft blue light floats before you-delicate, yet seeming to contain the entire cosmos within.\nA surge of joy wells up inside you-this is what you've been seeking.\nYou gently step forward and grasp it.\n\"Ah!\" A short cry startles you into opening your eyes.\nYou're surprised to find yourself still standing in place.\nStarjey stands before you, covering her face, visibly flustered."
 wg_astesia.118.a:"Are you okay? Did I do something wrong?"
 wg_astesia.119.desc:"Starjey's face turns slightly red, saying she's fine, but unable to hide her panic."
 wg_astesia.119.a:"So, was the divination successful? Come to think of it, I haven't even asked what you were divining about."
 wg_astesia.120.desc:"\"Successful... No, no, no, not at all!\" Starjey's blush deepens as she shakes her head vigorously.\nThen, as if remembering something, she quickly adds: \"I... I need to analyze the results first. You should go back and rest. Yes! Go back now. It'll take me a long time to get the results.\"\nShe hastily cancels her projection. After that, you can't reach her anymore. Looks like you'll have to head back for today."
 wg_astesia.120.a:"Still so curious-what exactly did she divine?"
 wg_astesia.120.a.desc:"However, Starjey never mentioned the content of that astrological reading again."

 wg_astesia.122.title:"Synthetic Being Technology Breakthrough"
 wg_astesia.122.desc:"With another breakthrough in imperial science, our researchers have finally unraveled the Esoteric secrets of consciousness and the body.\nPerhaps we can now create a true physical form for Starjey."
 wg_astesia.122.a:"Quickly share this good news with Starjey."
 wg_astesia.123.desc:"\"Reconstructing a body? I... maybe it's better not to. This is fine as it is,\" Starjey hesitates."
 wg_astesia.123.a:"There's a gala coming up. If possible, Miss Starjey, would you accompany me?"
 wg_astesia.124.desc:"Starjey hesitates for a long time, but eventually gives in to your persistent persuasion and agrees."
 wg_astesia.124.a:"Notify the empire's finest fashion designer-I want to commission the best possible evening gown."
 wg_astesia.125.desc:"The body, reconstructed with 100% accuracy from data provided by Starjey and assembled by the empire's top technicians, has now been transported to the research hub.\nAll debugging is complete. §HIt's time§!."
 wg_astesia.125.a:"Let's begin"
 wg_astesia.126.title:"Starjey failed"
 wg_astesia.126.desc:"All transmission channels have been established. However, Starjey is completely §Runable§! to upload her consciousness into the new body.\nAfter multiple attempts yield no progress, you are forced to declare a temporary suspension of the project."
 wg_astesia.126.a:"Find the problem at all costs."

 wg_astesia_special_project_1:0 "Find the Cause of Failure"
 wg_astesia_special_project_1_DESC:0 "We must discover the reason blocking Starjey's consciousness transfer. In the worst-case scenario, our synthetic being technology may have serious flaws."

 wg_astesia.127.title:"Found nothing"
 wg_astesia.127.desc:"Unfortunately, the empire's scientists have done their best, §Hbut have found no issues§!. We can only hope future technological advances will provide a breakthrough."
 wg_astesia.127.a:"Damn it"
 wg_astesia.127.a.desc:"§REvent chain ended§!"

 wg_astesia.128.title:"Found nothing"
 wg_astesia.128.desc:"Unfortunately, the empire's scientist has done their best, but §Hno issues have been identified§!. The Chief Researcher suggests you try contacting §H[wg_fallen_empire.GetName]§!."
 wg_astesia.128.a:"Contact §H[wg_fallen_empire.GetName]§!."
 wg_astesia.129.desc:"\"Ah, what? You need help modifying an AI into a scale figurine? ...Ahem, don't worry-this kind of task is no challenge at all for seasoned tech otaku like us. We dare say nobody would claim to be second if we claim first. Whether it's surface world or underground scenes, loli dragons or mecha girls, display models or articulated figures, ancient BJDs or modern nanomachines-we've got it covered.

 wg_astesia.129.a:"Is this really reliable?"
 wg_astesia.130.title:"Another failure"
 wg_astesia.130.desc:"Although the fallen empire's technology seems like divine miracles to us, we still haven't made any effective progress. §H[wg_fallen_empire.GetName]§! even used various unheard-of technologies to reconstruct a new body, but the result was the same as before.\nThe most troubling part is, we don't even know why it failed..."

 wg_astesia.131.a:"WARNING: Source localization entry is incomplete"
 wg_astesia.132.desc:"\"Please tell the researchers to stop... Admiral, you don't need to sacrifice any more for me.\"\nXingji lowered her head, her long bangs hiding her expression."
 wg_astesia.132.a:"No way!"
 wg_astesia.133.desc:"Xingji raised her head. Seeing your determined expression, the words she was about to speak were swallowed back.\nShe controlled her projection to move closer to your shoulder. The two of you sat together on the observatory steps as usual, gazing at the mysterious and unknown starscape."
 wg_astesia.133.a:"WARNING: Source localization entry is incomplete"
 wg_astesia.134.title:"The Silent Visitor"
 wg_astesia.134.desc:"Today, the Abyss Fallen, known for their silence, sent an envoy to your capital. True to their nature, they said nothing beyond requesting an audience with you."
 wg_astesia.134.a:"Might as well go see them."
 wg_astesia.135.desc:"After meeting you, the Abyss Fallen envoy handed over a rectangular device and a document.\nAfter a moment of silence, the envoy simply said 'Take good care of her' before leaving without another word.\nFollowing the instructions in the document, you opened the device-and inside was a body you recognized instantly!"
 wg_astesia.135.a:"Immediately assemble the research team and contact [wg_fallen_empire.GetName]!"
 wg_astesia.136.desc:"This might already be our last hope. The empire's research team and [wg_fallen_empire.GetName]'s research group are conducting final checks. You repeatedly confirm all safety measures, searching for any possible flaws.\nXingji's projection quietly follows behind you.\nYou feel something brush against your arm. Looking down, it's her projection device. You realize something, and turn around-Xingji, already prepared, meets your gaze. She smooths her skirt and gives you a gentle smile."
 wg_astesia.136.a:"Alright... let's begin."
 wg_astesia.137.desc:"Xingji connects to the device. Her consciousness begins uploading successfully. The scientists present hold their breath, closely monitoring the data flow. But almost instantly, the data transfer completes, and Xingji's signal vanishes from the research hub.\nJust as you jump up anxiously, ready to shut down the machine and activate emergency protocols, the device suddenly powers on.\nYou see the familiar girl open her eyes, slowly rise, look at you, and smile softly-with tears glistening in her eyes."
 wg_astesia.137.a:"...!"
 wg_astesia.138.desc:"Perhaps millennia may bury physical boundaries\nPerhaps endless drifting may block the path home\nThe bird above the hall has lost its wings\nThe traveler who strayed into a foreign realm wanders aimlessly\nPerhaps every reunion is just a prelude to separation\nPerhaps every joy and sorrow will eventually fade into silence\nThe bird drifts into unknown starfields\nThe traveler falls into eternal dreams\nSome say a ball can shake off all the mud\nSome say a mountain can block all the wind\nThe stars remain silent\nRipples dissipate as the final crystal sigh\nSome say a stream can wash away all sorrow\nSome say sunlight can dispel all gloom\nThe stars remain silent\nQuietly rising, forming eternal ripples that fade\n\nUpstream of the universe lies dream\nUpstream of emotion lies love\n\nShake off the mud-the bird of the hall regains its wings\nBlock the wind-the bird of the hall soars high\nThe stars now speak aloud\nRising proudly, a momentary palace ascends\nCrossing the stream-the bird of the hall shines pure\nBathed in sunlight-the bird of the hall finds peace\nFly, become an eternal dream\nFly, become everlasting love\nI met you\nThat blue silhouette\nThat perfect Elven being\nThe bird soars proudly above the hall."
 wg_astesia.138.a:"Xingji, welcome home."
 wg_astesia.139.desc:"Afterward, we conducted a full examination of Xingji. Surprisingly, this is a carbon-based body. Even more astonishing, her cells appear completely ageless. The lead researcher concluded she has truly achieved immortality. Moreover, Xingji feels her psionic power has increased dramatically."

 wg_astesia.139.a.desc:"§YAcquired Research Leader Xingji.§!\nNew option unlocked in communication interface: §HDate Xingji§!\n§YEach date occurs every four months.§!"

 wg_astesia.140.desc:"Since Xingji obtained her body, you've clearly noticed she's much more lively than before. Never mind anything else-just look at yourself now, carrying shopping bags in the mall, which says it all."
 wg_astesia.140.a:"Wait up, Xingji!"
 wg_astesia.141.desc:"Admiral, do I look good in this outfit?"
 wg_astesia.141.a:"You look good in anything."
 wg_astesia.141.b:"It suits you perfectly."
 wg_astesia.142.desc:"Give a proper answer, seriously."
 wg_astesia.142.a:"It's nice-let's buy it first."
 wg_astesia.143.desc:"Ugh, you keep saying the same thing-can't you come up with something new?"
 wg_astesia.143.a:"As long as you're happy, everything is fine."
 wg_astesia.144.desc:"Watching Xingji happily picking out clothes, you suddenly feel that the beauty of the world is truly found in moments like this."
 wg_astesia.144.a:"It would be even better if someone could help me carry my bag."


 wg_astesia.146.desc:"As Xingji stands on stage wearing her resplendent gown, her eyes flicker with memories of that summer when the commander took her to a newly built resort world to listen to the tides. The wind at the naval base quietly brushes across the lake, rippling the sky's crystal-clear reflection.\nSince it was only recently constructed, only select personnel from the base have been allowed here. Elite shipgirls come to unwind, shedding the stress accumulated during their daily duties-clearly, this resort world perfectly meets their needs: gentle breezes, sandy beaches, flowing water, and grilled saury sizzling by the roadside. With absolute control over the planet's climate, this place exudes lazy, cozy summer vibes all year round. Scattered shipgirls lounge in the water, playfully splashing with their ankles, refracting dazzling colors under the sunlight. Delicate laughter rings out, piercing the water and sending ripples scattering outward."
 wg_astesia.146.a:"So why do we have to dress like this?"
 wg_astesia.147.desc:"You and Xingji are now sitting on lounge chairs, gazing at distant seagulls. Her eyes follow the birds as they merge into the horizon. Hearing your words, she turns back and looks at you, tightly wrapped in a specially designed hooded suit. The outfit was made based on Xingji's memory; under its coverage, you resemble some mysterious hooded figure.\n\"If we get recognized, it'll be troublesome. The next day's naval base newspaper would be dominated by headlines like 'Commander secretly vacations with Research Hub AI.' This garment was custom-made based on my memory of the 'Doctor's' clothing. According to the Doctor's daily behavior, this outfit maintains warmth and moisture year-round, keeps you warm in winter and cool in summer, and never needs changing.\""
 wg_astesia.147.a:"Doctor?"
 wg_astesia.148.desc:"Xingji seems to pause for a moment, then quickly changes the subject. You stand up, adjusting to the strange sensation of the specially crafted clothing, suppressing for the third time the urge to eat instant noodles from your mouth, and glance toward nearby swimsuit-clad shipgirls-only to have Greywind push your head back down.\nSuddenly, a seal's mournful cry reaches your ears. You and Xingji turn around simultaneously, just in time to see a propaganda team of shipgirls grabbing a seal and bludgeoning its head with their ship-mounted cannons. The leading shipgirl stops upon seeing Xingji, her mischievous gaze darting between you two, flashing a knowing smile.\n'Miss Xingji, the resort world amusement park has just opened-would you like to take your friend along? I'm sure it'd be a rare experience for both of you.' Before finishing her sentence, she already turns to look at you, her professionalism reminding you of a certain familiar creature from the commerce department... Hmm, even her ship rigging looks similar."
 wg_astesia.148.a:"Well then, shall we go, Xingji?"
 wg_astesia.149.desc:"After receiving your reply, the shipgirl turns sharply, delivers another cannon strike to the seal's head, and leads her team away amid the seal's renewed cries. Xingji turns to face you, appearing somewhat hesitant..."
 wg_astesia.149.a:"(Step forward and take her hand) Let's go."
 wg_astesia.150.desc:"You feel her hand stiffen slightly, then relax completely in yours. A faint warmth and softness radiate from her palm.\nTime seems to stand still. Even the distant laughter of shipgirls fades into indistinct white noise. Xingji lowers her head, murmuring something unintelligible-words carried off like whispers in the wind..."
 wg_astesia.150.a:"Let everything become a whisper in the wind; simply enjoy this summer sunshine and playful recreation."

 wg_astesia.152.desc:"I heard Xingji recently built a workshop in the imperial capital and has been busy inside without anyone knowing what she's doing. Curious, you decide to go check it out."
 wg_astesia.152.a:"(Knock on the door)"
 wg_astesia.153.desc:"Ah, Commander, welcome to visit my workshop."
 wg_astesia.153.a:"What has Xingji been busy with lately?"
 wg_astesia.154.desc:"Ah, I've been trying to recreate my celestial globe-it should be an important tool I used long ago."
 wg_astesia.154.a:"Should be?"
 wg_astesia.155.desc:"It must have been before Endoria. It's too far back; I can't even recall where I was or what happened. But I still have a vague memory of how to make it. Since work has been light recently, I thought I'd give it a try."
 wg_astesia.155.a:"I'll assign some researchers to assist you."
 wg_astesia.156.desc:"\"No need! I just finished the final step.\" Xingji inserts a tiny dial into the sphere in her hand, then channels her unique psionic energy into it\nA massive blue beam shoots into the sky, and suddenly the heavens turn pitch black, stars emerging one by one.\nXingji herself seems startled, quickly withdrawing her psionic energy. The celestial phenomenon slowly vanishes. She sheepishly places the celestial globe back onto the workbench."
 wg_astesia.156.a:"Whoa, isn't it daytime right now?"
 wg_astesia.157.desc:"The celestial globe should be fine; perhaps I underestimated the amplification level of my own psionic power.\nShe looks up at you, only to find you staring at her very seriously.\n\"Erm... Commander, I'm sorry.\""
 wg_astesia.157.a:"(Pat Xingji on the head) Next time you do such experiments, at least include me. If anything goes wrong, I'll protect you."
 wg_astesia.158.desc:"Xingji smiles faintly, a blush briefly crossing her face, then softly hums in acknowledgment."
 wg_astesia.158.a:"(Pinch Xingji's cheeks gently)"


 wg_astesia.160.desc:"Xingji mysteriously summons you today. After confirming no one else is around, she hands you a beautifully wrapped box. Inside lies... a fountain pen?"
 wg_astesia.160.a:"What a beautiful pen."
 wg_astesia.161.desc:"\"I created this pen using my abilities, sealing within it some special powers. Commander, you can try it out once you're back. But remember-one condition: the first use must be by you alone, and you must be completely by yourself.\""
 wg_astesia.161.a:"I will treasure it dearly."
 wg_astesia.162.desc:"\"Ah, no-not exactly for safekeeping...\" A sudden blush flashes across Xingji's face. \"You decide what to do with it. I... I'll go now!\""
 wg_astesia.162.a:"Utterly confused."

 wg_astesia.164.title:"Migratory fowl among the stars"
 wg_astesia.164.desc:"Recently, Xingji has been so immersed in research that she temporarily secluded herself within the Research Hub. Without her company, returning to normal life leaves you feeling like something is missing.\nAt your desk, you reminisce about every little moment shared with Xingji. Have these beautiful memories settled deep enough in your heart?\nAfter soul-searching, you decide..."
 wg_astesia.164.a:"§YIt's time.§!"
 wg_astesia.164.b:"No, maybe not yet."
 wg_astesia.165.title:"A Girl's Message"
 wg_astesia.165.desc:"You take out the fountain pen Xingji gave you. Ever since she gifted it, you've kept it carefully, never daring to write with it. But now-this is exactly the right moment.\nYou unscrew the cap. Suddenly, the nib flows with galaxy-like, shimmering ink, writing on paper the three words you most want to say to her. Looking at it, recalling Xingji's earlier words, you realize you've been acting like a fool.\nSo, what are you waiting for?"
 wg_astesia.165.a:"Summon my executive team immediately and arrange everything according to my instructions as quickly as possible."

 wg_astesia.166.desc:"Within the Research Hub, there is no concept of day or night-only the unchanging void of space. During rest time, Xingji gazes blankly outside, her mind filled entirely with thoughts of the Commander. At that moment, a message from the central system interrupts her reverie.\n'Go assist at the observatory?' Xingji wonders-shouldn't there be no active projects there right now? Still, she takes the elevator up to the top floor.\nThe observatory is pitch dark, its dome closed. Xingji tries to activate the lights but fails. She frowns slightly-'Could this be a prank?'\nThen, the dark dome slowly opens. Within the otherwise static cosmos, delicate strands of blue light begin to glow. They emerge gradually, weaving into a galactic model-a familiar colossal structure, the Xingji from the Gates of Tears. Then, the lights shift, forming a new galaxy: [capital.system.GetName], and Xingji after successful jump transit. The glowing threads intertwine continuously, narrating every detail of Xingji's journey since her arrival.\nFinally, the light converges, shining upon the center of the observatory.\nThere, the Commander kneels on one knee, pulling out a ring prepared long ago."
 wg_astesia.166.a:"Miss Xingji, I love you. Will you marry me?"
 wg_astesia.167.desc:"A single tear rolls down Xingji's cheek, washing away the scars forged by millennia of pain in an instant.\nXingji rushes to you and pulls you tightly into her arms, tears flooding like a broken dam.\nYou gently wipe her tears, softly comforting her.\n\nAfter a long while...\nXingji stops crying, lying in your arms like a gentle little cat.\nYou take out the ring; its dazzling diamond pales compared to her radiant presence.\nObediently, Xingji extends her hand, letting you slide the ring onto her ring finger.\n\"As long as you never leave me, I shall forever stand by your side,\""
 wg_astesia.167.a:"A long, deep kiss"

 wg_astesia.169.title:"Doctor Miao hides under the desk"
 wg_astesia.169.desc:"One day, at your office desk, worn out from dealing with lingering frontline war issues, you drift off to sleep while reviewing documents.\n\"Commander, are you there?\" Xingji gently taps the door, holding a starry cake she had spent ages finally perfecting.\nNo response. Xingji quietly pushes the door open-you're still fast asleep, completely unaware.\nShe tiptoes toward you, slowly setting the cake down, afraid of startling you even slightly.\nAs Xingji turns to leave, she suddenly remembers something and walks behind your chair, glancing beneath the desk.\nNothing is there.\nLetting out a long breath, she feels puzzled-what exactly was she worried about?\nGazing at your sleeping face, she can't resist leaning forward and placing a soft kiss on your lips, then quietly slips out of the office"
