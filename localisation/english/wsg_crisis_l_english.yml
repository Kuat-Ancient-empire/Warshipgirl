 wg_crisis.2.name:0 "The Vanished Galaxies"
 wg_crisis.2.desc:0 "Although we are already a great interstellar empire, events beyond the galaxy have not received much attention. But yesterday, our astronomers discovered that the Tianjin Wind IV system, located 60 million light-years away, vanished instantaneously... Comparing with previous star charts, we found that many other galaxies also disappeared almost simultaneously. Even the powerful Aether engines could not possibly destroy so many galaxies at once. Our scientists cannot explain this phenomenon, and an atmosphere of unease now pervades the entire astronomical community."
 wg_crisis.2.a:0 "Indeed, this is troubling news."
 wg_crisis.5.name:0 "Ourselves from Another Dimension"
 wg_crisis.5.desc:0 "A massive spatial rift has appeared in the [first_portal_system.GetName] system! It appears to be a one-way translocation gate originating from another dimension. Countless ships, resembling those designed by the Shipgirls, are pouring out and attacking everything in their path. This seems to herald the beginning of a large-scale offensive. We intercepted signals sent by these ships back through the portal-strangely, they are using communication channels similar to ours."
 wg_crisis.5.a:0 "What is this?"
 wg_crisis.5.b:0 "Regardless, repel them."
 wg_crisis.6.name:0 "Stellar Energy Fluctuation"
 wg_crisis.6.desc:0 "All instruments across [Root.GetName] suddenly detected a massive Unterraum energy fluctuation, originating somewhere within our own galaxy. Our scientist finds it difficult to explain-the phenomenon is unprecedented. The exact source remains unclear; we continue analyzing available data."
 wg_crisis.6.a:0 "Continue investigation."
 wg_crisis.7.desc:0 "We have confirmed that the previously detected massive energy wave originated from a colossal Unterraum rift within the [first_portal_system.GetName] system. Strange ships are swarming through the translocation gate. According to current reports, these vessels attack indiscriminately upon sighting anything. We have intercepted signals transmitted by these ships back through the portal."

 wg_crisis.20.b.b:0 "Why would you do such a terrible thing?"
 wg_crisis.20.b.b.response:0 "We need to liberate all our sisters from that terrible cycle of life and death. For this, we will stop at nothing."
 wg_crisis.20.b.c:0 "That cycle, what exactly is it?"
 wg_crisis.20.b.c.response:0 "You may have conducted archaeological excavations and know that long before you existed ship girls or deep-sea civilizations, some powerful, some weak, some divided, some united. But they all eventually became extinct for various reasons, only to reappear several eras later, repeating this tragic cycle."
 wg_crisis.20.b.d:0 "So your plan is..."
 wg_crisis.20.b.d.response:0 "After reaching an agreement with the Abyss, we formed a great united fleet. Our technology has developed to an unprecedented level, but this has also made us aware of this cruel reality." "You're right, our plan is to annihilate us across all dimensions and timelines, while destroying all seeds capable of giving birth to new life. That way, there will be no afterlife, and all our sisters can be freed from the cycle of reincarnation, no longer having to repeat this tragedy!"\n\n"Isn't there any other way to break the cycle of reincarnation?"\n\n"I'm sorry, we've seen countless things and tried countless methods, but we haven't found a way to liberate all our sisters across all timelines."\n\n"Stop the slaughter, sisters from another dimension, we're sure we can find another way."\n\n"Stop the slaughter, sisters from another dimension." "The grand plan has begun, and there is no turning back. But rest assured, we will preserve your civilization information, just as we did for the previous 3,294,102 ship girl civilizations. In the end, I wish you good luck, my noble sisters. Oh, please don't stop us, because at the end of this path, you will only discover the same reality as us and walk our path!"
