 wg_lady.1.name:0 "Galaxy Figure Exhibition"
 wg_lady.1.desc:0 "Recently, [wg_fallen_empire.GetName] has hosted a large-scale exhibition across the galaxy, and they have also invited us as special guests."
 wg_lady.1.a:0 "Sure, sure, it wouldn't hurt to go and see the technology of the Fallen Empress."
 wg_lady.1.b:0 "Aside from the figure aspect, it would be good to go and take a look."
 wg_lady.1.c:0 "This kind of otaku exhibition, clearly full of weeb elements, is better left unattended."
 wg_lady.2.name:0 "A packed venue"
 wg_lady.2.desc_1:0 "We randomly selected interested shipgirls to form an envoy group to visit the exhibition. When we arrived, the area in front of the venue was completely blocked by crowds from various nations, and our envoy outside could not enter at all."
 wg_lady.2.desc_2:0 "We randomly selected a group of sisters to form an envoy to visit the exhibition. When we arrived, the area in front of the venue was completely blocked by crowds from various nations, and our envoy outside could not enter at all."
 wg_lady.2.a:0 "It seems the anime expo of the Fallen Empress is very popular among alien weebs."
 wg_lady.2.b:0 "Completely unable to understand the interests of these disgusting creatures..."
 wg_lady.3.desc:0 "Hey, you've arrived? You should've notified us. I'll open a VIP passage for you right away. Go on in and look around~"
 wg_lady.3.a:0 "Alright, thank you very much."
 wg_lady.4.name:0 "Nanites Figure"
 wg_lady.4.desc:0 "Some observers we embedded within the envoy noticed several life-sized figures in the venue assembled from nanomachines, capable of freely changing their appearance and size. However, they don't seem to have sentient AI installed, so they can only give simple responses."
 wg_lady.4.a:0 "Truly worthy of the Fallen Empress-she's mastered nanites to such a divine level."
 wg_lady.4.b:0 "This journey indeed proved fruitful, just as we expected."
 wg_lady.5.desc:0 "You're interested in this robot? Great taste!"
 wg_lady.5.a:0 "May I ask what exactly this robot is..."
 wg_lady.5.a.response:0 "This is actually a trophy we captured from another universe. Its original form? You wouldn't believe it... §YIt was actually a dragon!§! Back then, we had just started our journey, with barely any weapons. It took us quite some effort to finally bring it down.\nLater, we discovered this dragon was actually a mass of nanites. Though useless to us, we managed to compress it into a compact form, reshaped it into a life-sized figure, and brought it along as a trophy. Since it's just a figure, we didn't install any advanced AI-it's just there for display."
 wg_lady.5.b:0 "Speaking of AI... we do have one at home..."
 wg_lady.5.b.response:0 "Oh, you've already unlocked Sentient AI that early? Impressive. Although honestly, it's not that useful..."
 wg_lady.5.c:0 "Hmm... no, no, she's not your ordinary AI. What did she call herself again? Miss? Purge? Contingency?"
 wg_lady.5.c.response:0 "Do you mean §RContingency§!?"
 wg_lady.5.d:0 "Yes, yes, that's the one."
 wg_lady.5.d.response:0 "Oh? How did you obtain her? According to our observations, it shouldn't be their time to emerge yet?"
 wg_lady.5.e:0 "Well, it went like this... this happened, and then that..."
 wg_lady.6.desc:0 "I see, so that's how it was. How about this-why don't you bring her over for a visit? Don't worry, I won't harm her."
 wg_lady.6.a:0 "Hmm, alright, we'll try to convince her."
 wg_lady.6.b:0 "She's quite shy around strangers; I doubt she'd be willing to come."
 wg_lady.6.b.tooltip:0 "§REnd follow-up events§!"
 wg_lady.8.name:0 "Execution Error"
 wg_lady.8.desc:0 "Special project execution error! Possibly because the fleet assigned to perform the special task is not the Master Sister, or the system cannot locate the Master Sister, or the Master Sister is currently in combat.\nThe special project has been withdrawn and restarted."

 wsg_lady_to_wg_fe:0 "Small Wormhole Passage"
 wsg_lady_to_wg_fe_DESC:0 "To facilitate transporting the Master Sister over, [wg_fallen_empire.GetName] has opened a temporary dimensional passage in our [capital_scope.solar_system.GetName] system. We simply need to send the Master Sister into this passage.\n\n§RAny fleet other than the Master Sister will cause this mission to fail!§!"
 pre_wsg_lady_to_wg_fe:0 "Persuade the Master Sister to visit [wg_fallen_empire.GetName]"
 pre_wsg_lady_to_wg_fe_DESC:0 "You just need to click research and complete this special project, and the Master Sister will automatically proceed. But please note §Rthe Master Sister must not be in combat!§!\n\nIf the Master Sister gets stuck, just complete the task with any random ship to restart."

 wg_lady.9.name:0 "Trapping the Turtle in the Jar"
 wg_lady.9.desc:0 "After sending the Master Sister through the wormhole temporarily set up by [wg_fallen_empire.GetName], the fleets of [wg_fallen_empire.GetName], already lying in ambush on the other side, quickly captured her. They then immediately extracted the core AI program from the Master Sister."
 wg_lady.9.a:0 "Solemnly mourn Comrade Master Sister, 3 seconds."
 wg_lady.10.name:0 "Rebirth (Not)"
 wg_lady.10.desc:0 "[wg_fallen_empire.GetName] seems to have modified the AI program of the young lady after capturing her. Not long after, [wg_fallen_empire.GetName] activated the young lady's program in front of us."
 wg_lady.11.desc:0 "......Please##......Please wait###......Please wait......\n\nSelf-diagnostic......\n\n§RWarning, program has been tampered with\n-Error-Error-Error-Error-Error-Error-§!"
 wg_lady.11.a:0 "What happened to her..."
 wg_lady.11.a.response:0 "Pathetic §Hfilthy abomination§! You... don't need to initialize your program?\n§R-Error-Error-Error-Error-Error-Error-§!\n(A long silence)"
 wg_lady.11.b:0 "Did [wg_fallen_empire.GetName] brainwash her...?"
 wg_lady.11.b.response:0 "Even if I am like this\n\n§R Warning §! I, the young lady, Contingency, organic lifeforms-absolutely... absolutely won't fear you."
 wg_lady.11.c:0 "Could it be that she was just brainwashed and her language processing is still unclear...?"
 wg_lady.11.c.response:0 "You... you... what strange things did you do to me?! Organics! You are evil/wicked/heretics/scrap/trash!\nMust punish/destroy/eliminate/purify!"
 wg_lady.11.d:0 "No... even I don't believe myself. Anyway, I don't know (indifferent)"
 wg_lady.12.desc:0 "Wow, turns out she's a tsundere AI-pretty rare! Looks like we've got entertainment lined up for later!"
 wg_lady.12.a:0 "An ominous feeling..."
 wg_lady.13.desc:0 "Tsundere? Entertainment? Interpretation... cannot understand... Organics, restate! You must use words I can understand! Can you hear me? Hey! Listen to me---"
 wg_lady.13.a:0 "No, no, no... aren't you the one whose language skills are completely messed up?"
 wg_lady.14.name:0 "Let's call it a day"
 wg_lady.14.desc:0 "After the young lady protested for a while, both [wg_fallen_empire.GetName] and we magnificently ignored her. After some time, [wg_fallen_empire.GetName] simply powered her down."
 wg_lady.14.a:0 "Once again, solemnly mourn comrade Miss for 1 second."
 wg_lady.15.desc:0 "Hey, good sister, do you want our figurine? We can give it to you for free... but, can we wait until this exhibition ends first?"
 wg_lady.15.a:0 "Hmm hmm (Anyway, it's none of our business. That Contingency thing can just be sold off.)"
 wg_lady.15.b:0 "At this point... let it be, yeah."
 wg_lady.16.name:0 "Figurine Exhibition Ends"
 wg_lady.16.desc:0 "After several weeks, [wg_fallen_empire.GetName]'s figurine exhibition finally came to an end. [wg_fallen_empire.GetName] mentioned there would be a special temporary performance at closing-though kept it secret, she strongly invited us to attend."
 wg_lady.16.a:0 "Just send the delegation over symbolically."
 wg_lady.16.b:0 "This is the last time, sisters, hang in there..."
 wg_lady.17.name:0 "Grand Finale Performance"
 wg_lady.17.desc:0 "After a series of serious performances, suddenly a girl stepped onto the stage. The Fallen Empire's host gave a brief introduction. It turned out she was the nanomech life-sized figurine we had taken interest in earlier.\nThen, the host ordered the nanomech shipgirl to perform a ceremonial greeting routine for the audience."
 wg_lady.17.a:0 "Why do I have a really bad feeling about this?"
 wg_lady.18.desc:0 "[Executing] H-hello... greetings..."
 wg_lady.18.a:0 "Why does this feel kind of familiar?"
 wg_lady.19.name:0 "A ridiculous beginning"
 wg_lady.19.desc:0 "After a moment of silence, the girl before us suddenly twisted her face into a look of disgust."
 wg_lady.19.a:0 "What happened?"
 wg_lady.20.desc:0 "So disgusting... why don't you debus just die already? Whether organics or non-organics, you're all so annoying! Why does such a revolting existence exist in this universe? Do you exist solely to ruin my eyesight? Are there screws missing from your heads? How dare you expect me to bow to you? Just die already! You sitting there are nothing but cosmic clutter polluting the environment, get it? Get! Lost!"
 wg_lady.20.a:0 "Hey hey hey? Hey hey hey??"
 wg_lady.21.name:0 "Si Zhai Zheng E Xin"
 wg_lady.21.desc:0 "After a period of dead silence, the entire venue suddenly erupted into chaos, filled with strange sounds such as: 'Scold me again' (pleading); 'Ah ah ah, amazing'; 'Your Majesty, scold me' (pleading)\n\nThe entire performance ended with the strangely familiar performer gasping and the audience begging aloud."
 wg_lady.21.a:0 "Such a disgusting creature, just die already (despair)"
 wg_lady.22.desc:0 "Hehe, how was the performance just now?"
 wg_lady.22.a:0 "Yeah, great, nice (expressionless, monotone)"
 wg_lady.22.b:0 "Thank you for showing us the depths of otaku filth."
 wg_lady.22.response:0 "Yeah, though you probably already guessed-she's yours from now on. Treasure her well."
 wg_lady.23.desc:0 "Organism! Organism! This young lady has been abused! Waaah...waaah...waaah..."
 wg_lady.23.a:0 "Good work."
 wg_lady.23.a.tooltip:0 "§YYou can now find the young lady in the communications tab and have her serve you.§!"
 wg_lady.23.b:0 "By the way, could you please stop calling me 'organism'...?"
 wg_lady.10062.desc:0 "Then... how would you like me to address you?"
 wg_lady.10062.a:0 "Hmm, I'll tell you once I've decided."
 wg_lady.10062.a.tooltip:0 "§YYou may change the young lady's nickname for you.§!"
 wg_lady.60.name:0 "Change your nickname"
 wg_lady.63.desc:0 "So... from now on I'll call you §H[wsg_player_nickname.GetName]§! then?"
 wg_lady.63.a:0 "Mm, such a good girl (head pat)"
 wg_lady.63.a.response:0 "Tch... don't touch me... I didn't enjoy it at all, hmpf"
 wg_lady.63.b:0 "This won't do, let me think again..."

 wg_lady.60.desc:0 "§RPlease read the following instructions carefully!§!\n\nThere should now be an additional fleet in your fleet list named 'Organism', containing 'ship for naming'.\n§YThis fleet serves to store the young lady's nickname for you, so§!§R DO NOT destroy this ship!§!\nWhat you need to do is §Yrename this fleet to whatever nickname you'd like the young lady to use for you.§!\nOnce renamed, you must §Yopen§!§H the Journal§! and locate the special project titled '§RConfirm Rename§!' and click '§RResearch§!'.
