However, according to the news from the researchers working together, in addition to the necessary scientific research work, Astesia rarely communicates with others; more often, she is sitting on the upper star viewing platform, quietly looking at the stars. \n\nPlease open a new option in the Astesia communication UI: §HVisit Astesia§!."

 wg_astesia.101.desc: "You have come to the Science Nexus, where Astesia exists. The scientists of the Empire are very welcome to your arrival; in their warm embrace, you must first be accompanied by them to visit and understand the current research progress. \nAfter that, since you are too shy to contact Astesia directly, you looked for a long time but still did not find the intimate blue image.\nWatching the minutes tick by, you can't help but worry a little. Soon, a passing researcher suggests that you could check out the observatory on the top floor. Perhaps Miss Astesia will be there."
 wg_astesia.101.a: "Go at once"
 wg_astesia.102.desc: "You take the elevator to the observatory at the top of the Science Nexus. Here, various sophisticated astronomical instruments are placed around according to strict standards. \nYou carefully avoid the instruments and move forward. Eventually, the familiar girl was found under the giant telescope in the facility's center. \nThe light from the starry sky trickled down through the transparent dome. The blue-haired girl sat beside the telescope, quietly looking at the stars. \nYou did not want to break this quiet, standing behind her quietly. The two of them bathed together under the stars, feeling the profound and deep space. \n\"... Teitoku?\" \nYou come back from your trance only to find that the pole of the star has turned and is quietly looking at you. \nYou smile and sit down beside her."
 wg_astesia.102.a: "How are you getting used to living here recently? Is there anything that doesn't fit in?"
 wg_astesia.103.desc: "\"No, everyone here is very kind to me, both in life and at work...\" \nAstesia appears a little reluctant to speak and turns to look at you. \nYou are aware of the uneasiness hidden deep within Astesia, so you stop talking and quietly look at her, waiting for her reply. \nWith the encouragement of your gentle eyes, she hesitated for a long time and then said somewhat timidly, \"I'm a little afraid...\""
 wg_astesia.103.a: "What Happened?"
 wg_astesia.104.desc: "Astesia lowered her head, \"I am delighted to learn and research with everyone, but I always can't help but think of the time before Endoldia, when everyone was like now, desperately trying to work for the same goal, but they eventually...\" \nAstesia was silent, and there seemed to be tears in her eyes."
 wg_astesia.104.a: "It's all in the past."
 wg_astesia.105.desc: "Astesia is silent, and in such heavy sorrow, the words organized in your heart seem so pale and weak. \nYou open your mouth, trying to say something to ease it, but Astesia interrupts you, wanting to be alone.\nYou respected her advice and gently left the starlit place."
 wg_astesia.105.a: "That's not good. Talk to her more often."
 wg_astesia.106.title: "Worries about Astesia"
 wg_astesia.106.desc: "Since that incident, you have had several private discussions with several Imperial psychologists about the situation of Astesia. Now that you understand the possible consequences of this situation, you are more worried about Astesia than ever before."

 wg_astesia.106.a.desc: "The Visit Astesia option in the communication UI is available.\n§YNote: Visit CD is 4 months.§!"
 wg_astesia.107.desc: "You've arrived the Biology Lab with Astesia , where strange creatures from every planet are kept. Some are big and scary, others look small and docile. Astesia is at your side, explaining everything to you. \nDuring the tour, a green round creature resembling a loaf of bread catches your attention on the bench. The green creature curled up into a ball and looked surprisingly cute. A nearby display shows that the creature has been injected with a tranquilizer. \nWhen you pick it up, it feels surprisingly warm."
 wg_astesia.107.a: "Astesia, what is this?"
 wg_astesia.108.desc: "Astesia turned around to look while she heard the voice, immediately be frightened, quickly let you throw it out. But it was too late. In a flash, the creature suddenly began to expand violently, and for an instant gave off enormous heat, and then exploded, leaving you covered in black ashes. \nAstesia saw your dusty look, did not help laughing out. But she's still trying to hold back, and seriously educate you about your noncompliance with lab rules."
 wg_astesia.108.a: "emmmm…… Where's the towel?"
 wg_astesia.108.a.desc: "Astesia's Affection goes up"
 wg_astesia.110.desc: "You arrive at the Imperial Institute of Physics, and as soon as you enter, you see a giant particle colliding experimental machine. There, Astesia is conducting tests and collecting data with several scientists. Seeing how busy they are, you sit quietly and don't disturb them. Astesia at work is much more competent than usual, she skillfully controls the machine to work, and even forgets to control her own projection. Looking at the skilled work of those machines, from time to time through the holographic projection of Astesia, and the projection of the Astesia stood in place and did not move, so that the whole picture became funny. \nAfter a long period of time, after Astesia finished the work at hand, she noticed that you have been watching in the corner, and hurriedly stored the data on hand and controlled the projection to your side. \n\"Ah, when did Teitoku come? Do you want to see the experiment data?\""
 wg_astesia.110.a: "Take the Display Panel"
 wg_astesia.111.desc: "See you in that effort to pretend to be in a serious study of the data, Astesia smiled haplessly, took over the display panel, and explained the meaning of each piece of data for you..."

 wg_astesia.111.a.desc: "Astesia's Affection goes up"
 wg_astesia.113.desc: "You've come to the very heart of the Science Nexus, the Engineering Research Institute.\nBeing inside feels less like a research lab and more like a giant factory. All kinds of machines were running, making a great roar. A large number of auxiliary drones in good order between every gap and walkway, carrying a batch of supplies, looks spectacular.\nAt this time, a robot production line that looks somewhat familiar catches your attention.\n\"Ah, here is the production line of the robots I make for myself, and the robots you see under my control are built from here,\" Astesia explains to you beside you, and the figure of the girl shuttles back and forth in the streamline of the drones."
 wg_astesia.113.a: "Astesia...... Is there any way you can resurrect your body back"
 wg_astesia.114.desc: "The figure of the maiden suddenly stops, and you see her holographic projection in a slight tremor.\n\"Well... For the time being... I... It's better not to.\" \nAstesia looks a little lonely."
 wg_astesia.114.a: "You wisely did not mention this thing again but silently considered something in your mind."

 wg_astesia.115.desc: "Today, you have just arrived at your office and suddenly received an // e // mail inviting you to come to the Observatory, signed by Astesia."
 wg_astesia.115.a: "Glad to Go"
 wg_astesia.116.desc: "You arrived at the observatory on time, and there was no one in the huge observatory at this time. Astesia beckons you and invites you to come. \nYou stand in front of her, and Astesia turns off the lights of the observatory one by one and says to you,\n\"Teitoku, would you like to try astrology?\""
 wg_astesia.116.a: "Astrology? Isn't that pseudoscience?"
 wg_astesia.117.desc: "\"Teitoku, I don't know if you know this, but I have nothing to do with EDDY... Although memories from before that time are almost impossible to recall, some peculiar abilities remain, which are similar to psionic powers, yet different. I can still use it even now, and I call it astrology.\"\n\"Teitoku, do you want to try it?\" Astesia's eyes were full of expectations."
 wg_astesia.117.a: "You held out your hand and closed your eyes at the request of Astesia."
 wg_astesia.118.desc: "In the dark, there gradually appeared a ray of blue light, then, around the emergence of the stars, you subconsciously walk forward, one after another star appears in front of you, then disappears without a trace.\nSomehow you feel that you are longing for something, which drives you to continue to explore, you see brilliant supernovae, you see deep and scary black holes, and even see many strange and even indescribable things.\nIn the end, everything disappears behind you, in the endless darkness, leaving only a faint blue band of light suspended in front of you, the light is a soft, thin band of light, but it seems to contain the whole sky.\nA feeling of joy springs from your body, and you are looking for it.\nYou gently step forward and hold it.\n\"Yikes!\" A short scream that opened your eyes.\nYou are surprised to find yourself still standing in the same place.\nAstesia stands in front of you, covering his face, a little panicked."
 wg_astesia.118.a: "Are you okay? Did I do something wrong?"
 wg_astesia.119.desc: "Astesia's face was slightly red, mouth said nothing but completely covered up the look of panic."
 wg_astesia.119.a: "Did the divination succeed? Speaking of which, I never asked what the divination was about."
 wg_astesia.120.desc: "'It was successful... No, no, it wasn't!' Astesia's blush deepens, and she shakes her head repeatedly. \nThen, as if remembering something, she quickly says, 'I... I need to analyze the results first. You should go back and rest. Yes! You go back first, it will take me a while to get the results.' \nShe hurriedly cancels her projection. After that, you can't contact her anymore. It seems you'll have to head back for today."
 wg_astesia.120.a: "I'm still curious about what she divined."
 wg_astesia.120.a.desc: "However, Astesia never mentions the content of that divination again."

 wg_astesia.124.desc: "Astesia hesitates for a long time, but she can't resist your persistent persuasion and finally agrees."
 wg_astesia.124.a: "Notify the Empire's best fashion designer. I want the most beautiful dress made."

 wg_astesia.136.desc: "This might be the last hope. The Imperial research team and [wg_fallen_empire.GetName]'s research group are conducting final checks.

You realize what's happening and turn to see Astesia, who has already prepared herself. She adjusts the hem of her dress and smiles gently at you."
 wg_astesia.136.a: "Alright... let's begin."
 wg_astesia.137.desc: "Astesia connects to the device, and her consciousness begins to upload successfully. The scientists present tense up, closely monitoring the data.

 wg_astesia.139.desc: "Afterward, we conducted a comprehensive examination of Astesia. Surprisingly, it turned out to be a carbon-based body.

 wg_astesia.143.a: "As long as you're happy, that's all that matters."
 wg_astesia.144.desc: "Watching Astesia happily picking out clothes, you suddenly feel that there's nothing more wonderful in the world than this."
 wg_astesia.144.a: "It would be even better if someone could help me carry these bags."
 wg_astesia.146.desc: "When Astesia stood in the center of the stage in her elegant dress, her eyes reflected the summer when the Commander took her to the newly built resort planet, Listening Tide. The harbor wind blew quietly across the lake, breaking the clear sky like water.\nAs it was newly built, only department staff from the harbor were allowed to set foot here. Elite shipgirls came here to rest with the stress accumulated from their daily work, shaking off their exhaustion. Obviously, this resort planet perfectly met their requirements: breeze, beach, flowing water, and sizzling grilled mackerel by the roadside. With absolute control over the planet's climate, it is filled with the laziness and comfort of summer all year round. Scattered Shipgirls soaked in the water, their ankles lightly lifting up splashes, refracting dazzling colors under the sunlight. A few giggles fell into the water, splashing water droplets everywhere."
 wg_astesia.146.a: "So why are we dressed like this?"
 wg_astesia.147.desc: "You and Astesia are currently sitting on a lounge chair, watching a few petrels in the distance. Astesia's gaze rises and falls, following the distant birds as they merge with the horizon. Hearing your words, she retracts her gaze and looks at you, who is tightly wrapped in a special hood next to her. That hooded outfit was made according to Astesia's memory, and wrapped in it, you look like an unidentified hooded person.\n\"If we are recognized, it will be very troublesome. The next day's harbor newspaper will be filled with headlines like §LCommander privately vacations with Science Nexus AI§!, right? I made this outfit based on my memory of the §HDoctor's§! clothes. According to the Doctor's daily performance, this outfit is warm and moisturizing all year round, warm in winter and cool in summer, and does not need to be replaced."
 wg_astesia.147.a: "Doctor?"
 wg_astesia.148.desc: "Astesia seemed to hesitate for a moment before quickly changing the subject. You stood up, getting used to the strange sensation of the specialized clothing on your body. For the third time, you suppressed the urge to slurp some instant noodles and let your gaze drift towards the swimsuit-clad ship girls basking in the sun—only for Grey Wind to push your head back. \nThe sudden cry of a seal reached your ears. You and Astesia turned around simultaneously to see the Shipgirl propaganda team, one holding a seal while another bashed its head with her rigging cannon. The leader of the Shipgirls stopped when she saw Astesia, her cunning eyes darting back and forth between you and her, a knowing smile on her face. \n§YMiss Astesia, the resort planet's amusement park just opened—would you like to take your friend for a spin? I’m sure it’ll be an unforgettable experience for both of you.§! Before she even finished speaking, the Shipgirl was looking at you. Her sales pitch was so practiced it reminded you of a certain someone from the business department… even her equipment looked similar."
 wg_astesia.148.a: "Well then, shall we go, Astesia?"
 wg_astesia.149.desc: "After receiving your reply, the Shipgirl turned around crisply, and another cannon barrel hit the seal's head. Amidst the revived cries of the seal, she led the team away. Astesia turned to look at you, seeming a bit hesitant..."
 wg_astesia.149.a: "(Step forward and take her hand) Let's go."
 wg_astesia.150.desc: "You feel her hand stiffen noticeably, but then she allows you to hold it. You can feel the subtle warmth from her palm.\nTime seems to stop here, and the laughter of the Shipgirls in the distance turns into a vague white noise. Astesia lowers her head, murmuring something. It all turns into whispers carried away by the breeze..."
 wg_astesia.150.a: "Let everything turn into whispers in the breeze, just enjoy this summer sunshine and playful fun."
 wg_astesia.152.desc: "I heard Astesia has recently built a workshop in the Imperial Capital and has been busy inside all day long, not knowing what she's up to. Curious, you decide to go take a look."
 wg_astesia.152.a: "(Knock on the door)"
 wg_astesia.153.desc: "Ah, it's Teitoku! Welcome to my workshop."
 wg_astesia.153.a: "What has Astesia been busy with lately?"
 wg_astesia.154.desc: "Ah, I've been trying to recreate the celestial globe. It should be an essential tool I used a long time ago."
 wg_astesia.154.a: "Should be?"
 wg_astesia.155.desc: "It should have been before Endordia... It's been too long. I can't even remember where I was or what happened. But I still vaguely remember how to make this tool, and since work has been pretty light recently, I thought I'd give it a try."
 wg_astesia.155.a: "I'll go get some researchers to help you."
 wg_astesia.156.desc: "\"No need, I'm just at the last step.\" Astesia inserts a pocket watch into the sphere in her hand and then injects her unique psionic energy.\nA vast blue beam of light shoots straight into the sky, and then the sky suddenly turns dark, with stars appearing one after another.\nAstesia seems to be startled as well and quickly withdraws her psionic energy. The strange phenomenon in the sky slowly disappears. She awkwardly puts the celestial globe back on the workbench."
 wg_astesia.156.a: "Whoa, it's daytime, right?"
 wg_astesia.157.desc: "The celestial globe should be fine, I probably underestimated the extent of my psionic amplification.\nShe looks up at you and sees you looking at her very seriously.\n\"Emmmm, Teitoku, I was wrong.\""
 wg_astesia.157.a: "(Pat Astesia's head) Next time you experiment with this, at least call me. If anything happens, I'll protect you."
 wg_astesia.158.desc: "Astesia smiles slightly, a blush flashing across her face, and then softly hums in agreement."
 wg_astesia.158.a: "(Squeeze Astesia's cheeks)"
 wg_astesia.160.desc: "Astesia mysteriously asked you out today and, after making sure no one was around, handed you a beautifully wrapped box containing... a pen?"
 wg_astesia.160.a: "What a beautiful pen."
 wg_astesia.161.desc: "“I made this pen using my own abilities and sealed some special powers inside. Commander, you can try it out when you go back. But remember, the first time you use it, you must use it yourself and be alone.”"
 wg_astesia.161.a: "I will definitely cherish it."
 wg_astesia.162.desc: "“Ah, no, it's not for collecting either...” A blush suddenly appears on Astesia's face, “You decide for yourself, I... I'll go first!”"
 wg_astesia.162.a: "Confused."
 wg_astesia.164.title: "Fowl Among the Stars"
 wg_astesia.164.desc: "Recently, Astesia has been working in isolation at the research hub, busy with her studies. Without her company, you feel like something is missing as you return to your everyday life.\nAt your desk, you reminisce about the moments with Astesia, wondering if those beautiful memories have left enough weight in your heart.\nAfter soul-searching, you decide..."
 wg_astesia.164.a: "§YIt's time§!"
 wg_astesia.164.b: "No, maybe not yet."
 wg_astesia.165.title: "A Maiden's Message"
 wg_astesia.165.desc: "你拿出了星极送给你的那只钢笔。自从星极送给你后你一直珍藏着，没舍得拿来书写。但眼下，正是最适合它的地方。\n你扭开了笔帽，笔尖突然流出了如银河般绚丽的颜料，在纸上书写出了你最想对她说出的那三个字。看着眼前，回想起星极之前说过的话，你觉得自己像是个傻瓜。\n那么，现在还在等什么呢？"
 wg_astesia.165.a: "Gather my executive team, arrange everything according to my requirements as quickly as possible."
 wg_astesia.166.desc: "In the Science Nexus, there is no concept of day and night, only unchanging space. During break time, Astesia stares blankly outside, her mind filled with the Commander's figure. At this moment, a message from the central hub interrupts Astesia's thoughts.\n\"Help out at the observatory?\" Astesia ponders for a moment, shouldn't there be no projects there now? Even so, she takes the elevator to the top floor.\nThe observatory is pitch black, and the dome is closed. Astesia tries to turn on the lighting equipment but fails. She frowns slightly, \"Could it be a prank?\"\nAt this moment, the black dome slowly opens, and wisps of blue light suddenly shine in the unchanging space. The wisps of light emerge, slowly weaving into a model of a galaxy. The familiar giant building on it is Astesia on the Gate of Tears. Then, the light changes, forming a new galaxy, which is [capital.system.GetName] and Astesia, who successfully jumped. The light intertwines, telling the bits and pieces of Astesia's arrival.\nFinally, the light converges and shines on the center of the observatory.\nThere, the Commander is half-kneeling, taking out the ring he had prepared long ago."
 wg_astesia.166.a: "Miss Astesia, I love you, will you marry me?"
 wg_astesia.167.desc: "A tear rolls down Astesia's face, the scars from millennia of pain washed away in this moment.\nAstesia rushes to you, hugging you tightly, tears flowing like a broken dam.\nYou wipe away her tears and comfort her softly.\n\nAfter a long time...\nAstesia stops crying, lying in your arms like a docile kitten.\nYou take out the ring, the dazzling diamond not even a fraction as beautiful as the person beside you.\nAstesia obediently extends her hand, letting you put it on her ring finger.\n\"If you never leave me, I will never forsake you.\""
 wg_astesia.167.a: "A long, deep kiss"
 wg_astesia.169.title: "Doctor's Secret Under-Desk"
 wg_astesia.169.desc: "One day, at your desk, exhausted from dealing with leftover issues from the frontline battles, you fall asleep while reviewing documents.\n\"Knock knock\" \"Teitoku, are you there?\" Astesia knocks on the door, holding a starry sky cake that took her a long time to make.\nNo response. Astesia gently pushes the door open. You are still asleep, completely unaware of what's happening.\nAstesia gently walks up to you and slowly puts down the cake, afraid of accidentally waking you up.\nAstesia is about to leave, but suddenly seems to remember something and goes behind you to look under the desk.\nNothing is there.\nAstesia breathed a sigh of relief, wondering what she was worried about...\nLooking at your sleeping face, she finally can't resist leaning forward and giving you a light kiss before quietly leaving the office."
 wg_astesia.169.a: "......"
