At the end of it all, a legendary leader united all the Abyssal Shipgirls and led them to a brand-new future.\nHowever, this leader is a real departure from the norm, and undercurrents of mistrust have always swirled through Abyssal society.\n\n§YChange Ruler in this Origin will break the Event Chain.§!"

Time and again, strife has reduced our efforts at unification to nothing.\n\nBut one day, when the skies were gray, the seas were silent, and our survival was in jeopardy, a legendary leader appeared. [owner.Ruler.GetTitle] §RChaser§! puts in an unimaginable amount of effort to organize a large team and eventually unite all of the deep sea.\n\nNow that we've accomplished generalized hyperspace technology, we can finally look for our future among the stars."

For many Abyssal Flagships, this promise is more like a prophetic prophecy. However, some Flagships doubt whether it will come true. Despite recent advances in FTL technology, a small group of Abyssal Flagships started questioning the regime of §Y[Owner.Ruler.GetTitle] [Owner.Ruler.GetRegnalName]§! with that uncompleted promise.\n\nThe best way to silence these dissidents is to prove them wrong.

 wg_origin_sh_chaser.4.desc: "In a cabinet meeting, [Root.Owner.Ruler.GetName] clearly lacked form.\nThough she repeatedly emphasized that she was not experiencing personal problems as a result of her intense work, the Abyssal Flagships in the room all noticed the slightly out-of-control Abyssal energy from [Root.Owner.Ruler.GetName]. At some point during the sudden outpouring of those red and black mists, [Root.Owner.Ruler.GetName]'s image seemed to change drastically, and while no one commented on it, many Abyssal Flagships agreed that that image bore a strong resemblance to a Warship Girl."

She emphasized the range of accomplishments we have achieved together and pointed out that it would be highly unreasonable to let the mistakes of our past hold us back from moving forward. If [Owner.GetName] can stand together, there is nothing that we cannot overcome!"

 wg_origin_sh_chaser.21.desc: "The signal booster has been activated. Initial tests have proved sufficient to ensure stable communications in our space.\n\nIt now appears that the previous interference was an intentional act of sabotage. While the identity of the saboteurs remains unknown, the new system should protect us from any further interference."

 wg_origin_sh_chaser.40.name: "Command Deficit"
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.40.desc: "We have received several reports of ordinary Abyssal Shipgirls influencing the running of the industry. Allegedly, these Abyssal Shipgirls seem to have no superiors of their own, yet other Abyssal Flagships do not govern them."
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.40.a: "Initiate an investigation."
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.41.name: "The Unknown Power Raider"
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.41.desc: "Investigations have revealed that control of these Abyssal Shipgirls has been taken over by several Abyssal Flagships unrelated to the matter in question, who, strangely enough, know nothing about it. It has been suggested that other deep-sea flagships have transferred access to these depths to impede our work, but their identities and purposes are unknown now."
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.41.a: "We must remain vigilant."
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.50.name: "Cabinet Reorganization"

 wg_origin_sh_chaser.51.name: "Cabinet Clearance"

 wg_origin_sh_chaser.100.name: "Hanging in the balance"
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.100.desc: "A sharply worded report pointed the finger at our [Root.Owner.Ruler.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Ruler.GetRegnalName], claiming that she was a Warship Girl masquerading as an Abyssal Flagship with ill intentions and not to be trusted. A series of arguments, particularly regarding the technological and organizational changes she has brought about, seem to indicate that this report is accurate. Accompanying the report are several video recordings of a Warship Girl's presence in a highly classified area at times that closely match the whereabouts of [Root.Owner.Ruler.GetRegnalName]."
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.100.a: "A load of crap"

The explosions caused several floors to collapse, but luckily, the building itself was still structurally intact. To everyone's surprise, we found survivors from the rubble with §Y[Ruler.GetTitle] [Ruler.GetRegnalName]§!'s identifier, we were surprised to see a Warship Girl in front of us!"

Obviously, to [Owner.GetName], who had fought the Warship Girls countless times, the Warship Girls were undoubtedly a dangerous enemy. §Y[Ruler.GetTitle] [Ruler.GetRegnalName]§! must give an explanation for all of this, and the truth of what she is hiding will determine the fate of herself and of [Owner.GetName] as a whole."

 wg_origin_sh_chaser.103.desc: "§Y[Ruler.GetTitle] [Ruler.GetRegnalName] stood before the entire cabinet, but this time, it wasn't a discussion of policy guidelines but a trial of her.§!\n\nBefore I explain all of this, I apologize for the long time I have been concealing. The image of a Warship Girl does more harm than good to unite the Abyssal, so I have acted as the image of an Abyssal Flagship since the time of the Unite War.\nI will reveal my past to you to explain why I have this identity and yet exercise the powers of the Abyssal Flagship."
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.103.a: "Listen and see her story."
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.104.name: "Reveal"
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.104.desc: "At the start of it all, I was just an ordinary Abyssal light carrier, going through the motions of patrolling, fighting, and getting sunk.\nAs you know, on rare occasions, Warship Girls are born from the wreckage of destroyed Abyssal Shipgirls. I awoke in the debris, in the depths of a dangerous sea. With vague memories and luck, I escaped to land, avoiding as best I could the Abyssal Shipgirls patrolling around me.\nUnder the identity of a Warship Girl, I instinctively contacted other Warship Girls, cooperating if nothing else, hunting the Abyssal Shipgirls and exchanging supplies as a wandering Shipgirl. Abyssal Shipgirls have also killed each other in the past, so I don't see a problem with that."
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.104.a: "Warship Girls are like a reflection of Abyssal Shipgirls."
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.105.name: "Invert Identity"
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.105.desc: "Past memories guided me to devour the cores of other Abyssal Shipgirls, and as I hunted day in and day out, my power grew and eventually arrived at the heights of leader-type. Some of the Warship Girls noticed that my skin was ashen and my eyes were scarlet, but they only warned me to be careful of the effects of the Abyss environment and knew nothing of my secret. I carefully hid the changes in my body, and it was at that time that I mastered the art of changing my image.\nBut such days would not last forever; the Light Carrier was not meant for a lone fighting style, and I ended up in a battle where I was caught in the crossfire and sunk by an Abyssal Flagship as it should have been."
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.105.a: "But you didn't die."
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.106.name: "The Choice of Destiny"
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.106.desc: "Yes. Abyssal Flagships have so much more vitality than Shipgirls that even after sinking to the bottom of the ocean, I'm still alive.\nTossing and turning on the border between life and death, perhaps it was this ridiculous life that made me think, and I finally decided to put an end to this impulse-driven, meaningless war. So I organized a force as the Abyssal Flagship and eventually created the [Owner.GetName] of today.\nRegardless of what history thinks of me, I consider myself to have accomplished my ideals, saved everyone from that cycle of endless destiny, and returned freedom to civilization."
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.106.a: "We understand."

 wg_origin_sh_chaser.107.desc: "The whole [Owner.GetName] is arguing over the identity of §Y[Ruler.GetTitle] [Ruler.GetRegnalName]§!. Many Abyssal Shipgirls fiercely oppose [Ruler.GetRegnalName] being in power and calling for her complete expulsion from Abyssal society or even outright execution. The current situation is especially dangerous with this faction's vast power, almost to the point of triggering a civil war.\nAfter intense negotiations, the Cabinet will have to make a decision."
 wg_origin_sh_chaser.107.a: "Since [Ruler.GetRegnalName] has never failed us. We will not fail her!"
