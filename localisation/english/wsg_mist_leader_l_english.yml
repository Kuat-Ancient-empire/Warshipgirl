 wg_shimakaze.1.title:"Strange New Shipgirl"
 wg_shimakaze.1.desc:"Recently, when Dr. Yuzuki returned to the High-Energy Physics Laboratory, she discovered a battleship girl collapsed on the floor. After examination, it turned out this shipgirl had simply fainted from hunger. Once she woke up, we learned the full story. This shipgirl's name is Insula Kazagumo, hailing from a world in another spacetime. A month ago, she was sucked into a wormhole generated during Dr. Yuzuki's experiment and ended up in the lab, though Kazagumo cannot recall further details about her original world. Due to Dr. Yuzuki being preoccupied with data collection and securing the laboratory, Kazagumo was accidentally locked inside for three days and nights. Feeling guilty, Dr. Yuzuki took Kazagumo on a tour around the naval base and bought her a new set of clothes. A few days ago, Kazagumo conveyed her wish to join the base through the secretary ship. After a series of evaluations, the request was approved."
 wg_shimakaze.1.a:"A new shipgirl joining? That's wonderful news!"
 wg_shimakaze.2.desc:"Hello, nice to meet you-I'm Kazagumo! Ah-no, I'm Insula Kazagumo, the first vessel of the Insula Kazagumo Mark class. Pleased to meet you. No need to be so formal? Thank you. Then, I look forward to working with you. Oops, I accidentally used such polite words again... Hehe, my bad, my bad."
 wg_shimakaze.2.a:"Welcome aboard, little Kazagumo."
 wg_shimakaze.3.desc:"If there's anything Kazagumo can help with, just let me know! Delivering things, helping out-anything's fine!"

 wg_shimakaze.30001.desc:"It makes me so happy when everyone praises me. Huh? You don't get praised much, Admiral? Because doing well is expected of you? I see... Then let Kazagumo praise you! Huh? You don't want a head pat? Okay..."
 wg_shimakaze.30002.desc:"You're asking how Kazagumo uses her torpedo tubes? It's kind of like how carriers launch Strike Craft? Just tell the rigging-do this, do that-and it works. With enough practice, even more complex maneuvers are possible. Yes, this is Kazagumo's proudest equipment!"
 wg_shimakaze.30003.desc:"I often race with Fantasque. She's a great rival-we always end up in a tie. I should go for a run to prepare for our next match. Want to come along, Admiral?"

 wg_shimakaze.30007.desc:"You're so tall, Admiral. Even on tiptoes, I can't reach you. I'm so envious of such a big Admiral. Huh? A piggyback ride...? Mmm, that's kinda embarrassing. But... just this once... Wow, so high! Hehe, this is fun!"
 wg_shimakaze.30008.desc:"Once, Kazagumo thought she wanted to be like a cherry blossom-for everyone's smiles. But now, I'd rather be a cherry blossom that blooms for just one person. Because I want him to keep watching me. Admiral... is that not okay?"

 wg_shimakaze.30201.desc:"I have some tea that Taifon gave me. Why don't you take a break and have some together?"

 wg_shimakaze.30205.desc:"Sometimes I can't sleep at night... I just feel so lonely. Admiral, can you hold Kazagumo tightly? Mmm, so warm..."
