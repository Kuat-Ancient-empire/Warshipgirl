Our following researches are based on this assumption.\nThe Shroud is fulfilled with energy due to its specialty, and that gathered energy could possibly cause explosions and create new universes. By finding the flow pattern of these energies, we could find other universes through the Shroud, even realm at higher dimensions. So that the Shroud is the best springboard to reach other universes and dimensions, we can also consume the energy we need to reach other universes or dimensions.

Welcome to Universe No.0, our hometown, our place of origin.\n\nAccording to the standard workflow, you haven't passed our test yet. However, your performance is commendable enough. Since your strength is just above type V civilization, we can determine you have passed the test and stop attacking according to the Special Disposition Method.

However, suppose they don't have physical law manipulation technology or dimensional traversal technology. In that case, a civilization can develop to type IV civilization at most, which is the interstellar empire that can travel through the whole universe. A type V civilization can travel between dimensions and colonize in multiple parallel universes.\n\nBy the way, there are type 4.5 civilizations that convert themselves into pure energy creatures and live in subspaces. Of course, they successfully killed all of their own future.\n\nYou have opened the Gate, and you can travel through universes in different dimensions. In that case, you are considered as a type V civilization."

 ap_wg_crisis.1111.desc:0 "Well done, Cabot. I'll explain the rest. (Yes, Madam.)\n\nI am the First Flagship of the United Fleet. You can call me Ms.Zhang. About the previous question:\nWe, the United Fleet, once wished to lead all Shipgirls to escape from the fate of the cycle. But we failed. The power of UF cannot cover everyone. Many civilizations withered even with our protection and interference. \nIt will not be a problem if there is only one universe. Still, due to the countless parallel universes and multiple-dimension battlefields, we must choose a more efficient way, which is the test just mentioned by Cabot.\n\nIf they can pass it, they are competent enough to be independent.\nYou who are now in the era of civilization upgrade, I'm sure there will be a boon of technologies soon. Being invaded also teaches you how tough the outside is. Given time, you will quickly pass our test presumably. That's why the Special Disposition Method exists.\nBack to the topic, if you choose to cease fire, I hope you can join the United Fleet and fight with us for the sake of other Shipgirls until we beyond the cycle."
 ap_wg_crisis.1112.b.response:0 "It may be indeed meaningless for a spectator like us to watch a civilization keep struggling in this sandbox world, but trying to end the cycle is the meaning we give to ourselves and the value of our existence.\n\nSo, your choice is to keep testing at the higher dimension...Since you just reached the type V civilization, we will give you a grace time, and please utilize this time to be prepared.
