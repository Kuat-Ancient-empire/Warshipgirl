 wsg.1100.name:0 "Signal from Another World"
 wsg.1100.desc:0 "Not long ago, Dr. Yubari captured a directly interpretable signal in the micro-quantum laboratory. While the information contained wasn't particularly special, the signal itself was highly anomalous: timestamps and background noise indicate it should not exist in the same timeframe as us. Even more bizarre-§Ythe signal's modulation method and encryption algorithm are nearly identical to ours, and the asymmetric encryption key pairs can actually be found within our own database§!. As for the content... unless we are absolutely confident in quantum shielding, we'd rather believe this is just a prank by some mischievous individual among us.\n\nDr. Yubari points out that capturing a signal from a §Ydifferent spacetime branch§! is incredibly fortunate. In the quantum realm, even light does not travel in straight lines-tunnels themselves are formed by fleeting, random arrangements of imaginary numbers creating structured warps. These tunnels are extremely unstable; the slightest disturbance can drastically alter their properties-this signal might vanish into unreachable voids beyond our light cone in the next second. Therefore, the biggest issue now is that if we don't quickly lock onto each other's spacetime phase through this current anomaly, we may never contact them again-even if we wait until the heat death of our universe.\n\nUnfortunately, the archaeological team on [Root.Capital.GetName] has recently unearthed numerous relics originating from the §YAbyss§! during excavation. They strongly urge Dr. Yubari's team to analyze these fragile artifacts-whose atoms are inherently unstable-as soon as possible. The primary reason is that we accidentally damaged the Suspension Field capable of affecting atomic nuclei during excavation. Even more absurdly, most of these deep-sea relics are composed of highly radioactive materials with extremely short half-lives. In short, given the current preservation technology available to the research team, we cannot guarantee these strange objects will remain intact even after a few months."

These energy cores naturally form through the continuous consumption and assimilation of other Abyssals by an Abyssal vessel, serving as proof of becoming a leader-class Abyssal ship.\nSome early literature on combating the Abyssals indicates that the first generation of Shipgirls-the original pioneers-once acquired these cores and implanted them into their bodies. Though this caused severe side effects, it significantly enhanced their physical Strength. Dr. Yubari strongly recommends we initiate reverse-engineering research on these cores."

Individuals who consumed numerous Abyssal Shipgirls accumulated vast amounts of Abyssal energy internally, forming these Abyssal energy crystals and developing a degree of intelligence-this is the origin of leader-type Abyssals.\nThe spoils we mass-produce today contain trace amounts of Abyssal energy; thus, extracting and refining this energy from spoils can also produce such cores.\nDr. Yubari notes that Abyssal energy cores hold immense power, stating their energy efficiency exceeds zero-point energy sources by several times. Historical records suggest these cores can be safely implanted into Shipgirls' hulls or even their bodies, enhancing the overall capabilities of the Shipgirl race. However, the core itself is a major radiation source; without strict protective measures during production, it would cause severe environmental pollution affecting colonial development.\nAfter extensive research, Dr. Yubari's team has developed a specific refinement method for Abyssal energy and transferred it to the Research Department. Nevertheless, she notes that industrial-scale production remains some distance away."
