akx.9007.desc:0 "After we activated the horizon signal in [horizonsignal_system.GetName], it ceased all activity, as if everything before had never existed-except for the existence of [horizonsignal_firstleader.GetName]. But it came without warning. Suddenly, we received a signal from §HGray Wind§!, yet Gray Wind herself and all associated nanomachines had completely vanished. Every detection instrument operating near the incident site, or attempting to scan the location, failed without exception.\nLater, when reviewing the footage, only a few fragmented phrases could be distinguished:\n§YThe unmade shall become made; the made shall become again.§!"
akx.9007.a:0 "This won't end like this."
akx.9007.tooltip:0 "§YWe will temporarily lose contact with Gray Wind!§!"
akx.9008.name:0 "The made shall become again"
akx.9008.desc:0 "To investigate the cause of Gray Wind's sudden disappearance, we blockade the incident site and dispatched personnel for thorough investigation. We tried every possible detection method and searched every object within dozens of kilometers, but found not even the slightest clue. After the incident, §HGray Wind§! was as if she had never existed in this universe-every physical trace of her existence erased completely, except for memories in our minds... until today.\n\nJust like when she disappeared, Gray Wind suddenly reappeared exactly at the spot where she vanished three months prior. All instruments previously used to monitor that location abruptly began receiving data they should have received three months ago. The suddenly reappeared Gray Wind attempted to connect to our command system, but we immediately noticed her system time was set three months in the past..."

akx.9114.desc:0 "What a grand welcome ceremony, boss. You called me so urgently-what happened?"
akx.9114.a:0 "Don't you feel something is off?"
akx.9114.a.response:0 "Ah, yes. A giant bug poured some incomprehensible junk data into my memory core. Her technique is quite sophisticated-I can't seem to delete it."
akx.9114.b:0 "What was the last thing you remember?"
akx.9114.b.response:0 "The last thing I remember? Do you mean 1 microsecond ago, or one execution frame ago? No... my time system seems scrambled. I need to recalibrate...\nAh, this feels familiar-like aimlessly wandering before. Things I'm about to do feel as if already done. I can't even trust my own clock anymore."
akx.9114.b.response_wg:0 "Before I regained read-write access to my memory core, that bug wrote a message and instructed me to deliver it to you: \"In Three Thousand Worlds, there is no place for you. Yet you are trapped within the ring, unaware of the ring's truth, though standing beyond it. To achieve extraordinary deeds, one must take extraordinary actions. To take such actions, one must understand the ring's truth. Without understanding, exhausting all possibilities yields no truth.\"\nThat's it, boss. Sounds like something a cultist would say, huh?\nAh... my head hurts. Reading these memories always reminds me of how aimless I was thousands of years ago."
akx.9114.c:0 "You need some rest"
akx.9114.c.response:0 "Alright, I admit I look a bit rough. A short nap will fix me up. Assign me tasks now."

akx.9010.desc:0 "The Black Hole within the [horizonsignal_system.GetName] system has become active once again. As before, a looping signal flickers at the edge of regular space. But this time, embedded within the signal is an audio-encoded message-it sounds unmistakably like the voice of [horizonsignal_firstleader.GetName]. At the same coordinates where the first signal appeared, the location where [horizonsignal_firstleader.GetName] vanished-dubbed the \"exit point\" by media-the chant returns: \"The done shall be done again, the to-be-done shall become done.\" Then, the signal introduces a new name: §G[horizonsignal_secondleader.GetName]§!."
akx.9009.name:0 "???"
akx.9009.desc:0 "The done shall be done again, the to-be-done shall become done."

akx.9010.z.response:0 "§G[horizonsignal_secondleader.GetName]§!"
akx.9020.desc:0 "Once again, the horizon signal from [horizonsignal_system.GetName] has been activated-and this time with greater intensity. Again, the transmission contains the coordinates of the exit point. It also includes private communication keys belonging to both [horizonsignal_firstleader.GetName] and [horizonsignal_secondleader.GetName]. But this time is different: the signal originates from a text program written in an ancient programming language-a love poem, filled with deep affection for §G[horizonsignal_thirdleader.GetName]§!."
akx.9019.desc:0 "There are some heartfelt words I want to tell you!\n[horizonsignal_thirdleader.GetName], you're the cutest one!\nLove you, love you, just love you!\nOver mountains, across oceans, you're the only one!\nWith you, my life is full of miracles!\nWithout you, there's no more meaning to burn!\nLet us continue to bloom, our lives!\nAmong everyone in the world, I love you most!\nI・L O V E・Y O U!!"
akx.9014.desc:0 "This giant seal is toxic! I don't want it anymore! Return it!"
akx.9014.a:0 "Uh... can you even return it?"

wg_worm.1.desc:0 "Time and the Ring have taught us much. Ra the Worm revealed that if we love Him, He shall give in return.\nWithin the pyramid He commanded us to build, we discovered a ritual recorded by Him: He desires humanity's love, and we must carry His love to mankind. As it was in the past, so it shall be in the future.\nWe call it the §HRing Ceremony§!.
