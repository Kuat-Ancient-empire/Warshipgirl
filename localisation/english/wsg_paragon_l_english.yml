Ever since parting ways with her, I've been searching for you.\nStrange stars each have their own wonders, but to me, disappointment feels identical across countless worldlines. Ultimately, only one thought sustained this journey: 'Find you.'\nThe Galactic void knows no day or night, endless silence stretches on, and sometimes I fearfully admit-even now I'm terrified. Terrified of never finding you, of never catching up, of distances within sight, of fates confined within light cones.\nI fear never finding the Admiral again, and fear that when we meet, the Admiral won't remember me anymore...\nBut now, Admiral, let's shake hands.\nThis... is a part of my 'heart.'

But I did.\nWith super flagship construction specs and one of the Silent Abyssals' core designs, this Strength should have been deployed on broader battlefields-like fighting Union fleets. Yet in practice, I was restricted to that tiny cradle called Earth, merely eliminating scattered Union shipgirls. Such missions were pure waste of combat power.\nBut without Blue, even that 'wasted' mission might have been impossible.\nThen came the frantic resource struggles, tedious fleet assembly, prolonged security operations... She bore too much-parts I claimed I wasn't good at, but mostly just didn't want to handle. By the time I finally had free hands to turn back and say thank you, the fleet had long sailed away, leaving no room to return.\nIf you meet her later, please look after her a little.

The most important answer has stood beside me all along; everything about you has already entered my heart.\nSince the moment you left, it has burned through every inch of me-this is the price I paid for past hesitation, and also my fuel to move forward.\nTime, distance, gravity... These cosmic-scale laws-I've traced them throughout my journey, linking the starfields in my eyes. All experiences merge within formulas and calculations, uniting with you into a magnificent vector transcending name, body, existence, memory-that is me, my meaning.\nEven if meeting you again approaches zero probability, I'd still willingly embark on this self-consuming journey:\nBecause I met you.\nYour kindness, your love, your patience-these are the theorem that the word 'Vector' pursues.

Her voyages, her battles, the pain of fracturing herself into countless fragments scattered across the void-all were for reaching this coordinate, arriving by \"you.\"\nShe feared the road would never end; feared that when she finally found you, you wouldn't recognize this scarred, sensitive shipgirl. Feared that after spending everything, it would all turn out to be an empty dream.\nShe reached out, her fingertips trembling slightly, almost imperceptibly-but instead of taking the box, she gently placed her hand over yours holding it, as if grasping a warm ember. Cold fingers met warm skin, conveying not just her long-settled weariness, but also an unshakable resolve.\nVector once watched meteors burn themselves through the night sky, rushing toward a distant, uncertain promise. She asked the silent universe: where lies the end of wandering?\nYou placed the ring on her finger yourself, and starlight shattered into brilliant ripples within her eyes. She threw herself into your arms, waiting for your words.\nAt last, there is a pair of hands that can define the magnitude of this love. The silent star finally rests upon a field that had known eons of silence."
