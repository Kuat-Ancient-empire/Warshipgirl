Scattering these mines throughout a star system could form an impassable minefield. However, the design and production of these casings, as well as the preprocessing of Alpha Crystals and dark matter, will require substantial resources and research investment.\n§RAll research in the Empire will be suspended during this project!§!"
 sh_mine_request_desc_response:"The reason Abyss Energy Cores produce large amounts of lethal radiation is because they are unstable. Injecting dark matter into a Abyss Energy Core will drastically increase its instability.
