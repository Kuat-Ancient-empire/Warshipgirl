The emergence of this system also filled a critical gap in Admiral Lexington's tactical doctrine, earning her considerable respect among Resistance forces."

 ra_admiral.1004.desc:0 "\"Do you feel regret? Then live with it. Your fate belongs to you alone.\" These were the words spoken by the highest leader of the United Fleet-the very person who destroyed her homeland, looked identical to her, and choked her with his own hands.\nFor years, Admiral Cabot's eyes held only vengeance, dragged forward by fury until she encountered her second family-the Resistance. In that battle, she piloted a lone ship, attempting to take an entire United Fleet task force down with her. She succeeded-her vessel, battlesuit, body, everything pushed beyond limits. Fortunately, a passing Resistance patrol rescued this avenging angel. A new home rekindled warmth and meaning in her life, teaching Admiral Cabot to cherish the preciousness of existence."
