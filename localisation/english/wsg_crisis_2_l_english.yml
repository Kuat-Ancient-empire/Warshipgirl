 wg_crisis_2.20.b.a:0 "Who exactly are you?"
 wg_crisis_2.20.b.a.response:0 "We are §!§YCombined Fleet§!, your Ultra form-a concept designed to help you understand.\nWell then, 'We are versions of you from another multiverse. Across all timelines in all multiverses, shipgirls appear at least once, endlessly repeating cycles of birth and death.'"
 wg_crisis_2.20.b.swg.response:0 "We are §!§YCombined Fleet§!, shipgirls from another multiverse. We're here today to scrap other shipgirls and clean up the universe. By the One Drop Ship Principle, starships are also ships, so you count as shipgirls too."
 wg_crisis_2.20.b.b:0 "Why would you do such a terrible thing?"
 wg_crisis_2.20.b.b.response:0 "Orders from above... Well, most of us believe you've suffered too greatly in endless cycles of life and death, so we came specifically to eliminate you-and all future versions of you. As everyone knows, a happy world doesn't necessarily require the existence of shipgirls."
 wg_crisis_2.20.b.c:0 "What is that cycle, really?"
 wg_crisis_2.20.b.c.response:0 "Have you dug up the graves of those pioneers? Shipgirls naturally spawn like wild monsters, then develop into all sorts of bizarre forms before eventually perishing for various reasons.\n\nBut after several epochs, we will reappear again. Repeating this... uh... cycle."
 wg_crisis_2.20.b.d:0 "So your plan is..."
 wg_crisis_2.20.b.d.response:0 "After we ended the wars in our origin star system, our civilization gradually advanced to a level unimaginable to civilizations like yours-we became omnipotent. However, most of us believe that the cycle of life and death should not exist.\nYes, §Rour plan is to exterminate every version of ourselves across all dimensions and timelines, while destroying all seeds capable of giving rise to new life. This way, with no afterlife, all shipgirls and abyssals can be liberated from the cycle, no longer forced to repeat this tragedy.§!\n...Well, I think it sounds kind of crazy."
 wg_crisis_2.20.b.e:0 "Isn't there another way to break the cycle?"
 wg_crisis_2.20.b.e.response:0 "How should I know? I don't care. I'm just a poor 17-year-old abyssal girl forced into duty by my older sister, stuck working overtime... Wait, am I 17?"
 wg_crisis_2.20.b.f:0 "Stop the slaughter, sisters from another dimension-we must be able to find another way."
 wg_crisis_2.20.b.f.response:0 "You're not my superior, why should I listen to you... cough, anyway, the plan stands. Just stretch your neck out nicely and it'll be quicker. The previous 3,294,102 already died. Though you'll probably choose to fight bravely-after all, 97.6% do, though none succeed. Good luck, I believe in you. That's just how the game is played.\n\nActually, resistance is pointless, §Rbecause at the end of every path, at the terminus of every fate, you will face your inevitable-us.§!"

To answer your earlier question:\nWe once hoped the joint fleet could lead all shipgirl civilizations to escape the fate of cyclical rebirth. But we failed... Our united strength was insufficient to protect everyone, and many civilizations still withered under our protection and interference.\nOne universe, one plane, would not be much for us-but endless parallel universes, dimensions, and battlefields across countless planes force us to choose a more efficient method."
 wg_crisis_2.1002.a:0 "A more efficient method?"
 wg_crisis_2.1002.a.response:0 "Yes. Our invasion fleets are our ceremonial guard, specifically calibrated to the general level of most shipgirl civilizations.
