At that time, we just started our journey, and we hardly had powerful weapons. It took us a lot of effort to knock it down. \n\nLater, we found the dragon actually made up of nanomachines. Those nanomachines had little use to us, but they could easily be reshaped, so we formed them into this 1/1 figure. It is just a decorative item, without any AI programs."
 wg_lady.5.b:0 "Speaking of AI ... we seem to have one ..."
 wg_lady.5.b.response:0 "Sapient AI is nothing new, not to say it may out of control sometimes, although it helps us a lot."
