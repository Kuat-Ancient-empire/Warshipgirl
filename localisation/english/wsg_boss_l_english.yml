Seven distinct star systems' newcomers worshipped it as the god of early wars. Alas, its ultimate fate remains unknown, yet records of its exploits perished during the 6th early war crash and sudden demise. Since at least (early) the 5th incident, no one has bothered to debate the authenticity of its legends."

All that remains is to translate the information into our known language."
 wsgancrel.701.a:0 "Well done. Begin translation immediately"
 wsgancrel.702.name:0 "Translate"
 wsgancrel.702.desc:0 "The translation proceeded smoothly. The computer contains detailed records regarding Xingji's origin.\nXingji did not originate from the Endodia Empire, but instead came from a planet called Terra.\nThis planet frequently suffered from Crises. After each Crisis, numerous strange stones were left across the planet's surface, which the people of Terra called Originium. Measurements revealed that these stones contained vast amounts of highly pure energy. The locals utilized this property to develop a unique technological tree. Some individuals on Terra could even directly manipulate Originium energy-a skill they referred to as 'Originium Arts,' though its underlying principles remain unclear.\nHowever, abnormal contact with Originium leads to an illness known as Originium Disease. Infected individuals accumulate Originium particles within their bodies; in severe cases, Originium crystals even emerge on the skin. These crystals progressively degrade the body's normal functions, converting healthy cells into Originium, ultimately resulting in death and turning the victim into a source of contagion.\nXingji herself was also infected. In her final moments, she used what she called 'Astrology'-an application of Originium Arts-to send out a distress signal. It was received by a passing Endodia Empire Science Ship, which rescued and treated her. However, the Endodia Empire could not cure Originium Disease and instead preserved Xingji's consciousness.\nFor research purposes, Endodia scientists extracted Xingji's memories from Terra and implanted fabricated memories of being born and raised within the Endodia Empire. After integration, Xingji demonstrated extraordinary talent in weapons research, joining the Empire's highest-level weapons research institute, eventually becoming the core of the scientific hub."

After encountering technical difficulties, they concluded that only in a brand new universe could their powerful technology be fully realized.\nThus, they constructed a massive vessel called the Horizon Needle-a reality-altering ark designed to carry the entire civilization's Pops through a Black Hole into another universe.\nHowever, this plan appears to have failed completely. The document records little about what they encountered, merely stating that some unimaginable enemy effortlessly destroyed the Horizon Needle and annihilated the entire civilization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§RThey are there too!!!§!"

Although this megastructure has long been abandoned, there are still signs of activity within.\nOur investigation detected no biological life, but we successfully established contact with a consciousness. She claims to be the collective remnant of all those who died during the decades of the engine's operation-an entity that, in a sense, has become the machine itself. For tens of millions of years, she has drifted through the sea of nothingness, existing in confusion and haze. She pleads for us to liberate her existence from endless suffering."
