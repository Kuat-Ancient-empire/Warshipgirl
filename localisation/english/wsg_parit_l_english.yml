One player, known as GuGuShanShan, sought victory by bringing her fleet too close to Parit and engaging in fierce combat with other participants. In the end, tragedy struck: numerous destroyed ships fell into Parit's atmosphere. The Defense Army did not intercept them due to friendly IFF codes, ultimately destroying Parit's ecosystem. The remaining debris was captured by the planet's gravity, forming a thick debris cloud that made launching spacecraft from Parit extremely difficult and dangerous.\n\nNow we possess next-generation energy shield technology. Our science team proposes that we can melt away these stubborn debris by having ships activate their shields and deliberately collide with them."
