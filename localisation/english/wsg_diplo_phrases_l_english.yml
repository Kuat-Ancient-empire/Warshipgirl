 01_WSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Ah, isn't this our deep-sea sister? You're welcome to visit the port anytime-but wait, that fat... weapons factory over there is not open to the public."
 02_WSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Our dear deep-sea sister. Welcome to the port. Today's mess hall menu is prepared by Chef London-you've arrived just in time for lunch."
 03_WSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "May your port never be disturbed by Upstream One; may your chairs never collapse; may your women's restroom never see brawls."
 04_WSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Any shipgirl within the port who persecutes deep-sea forces will now be severely punished."
 01_WSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "Hi."
 02_WSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "We have no connection with you."
 01_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "How exactly can we eliminate vermin like you, who plunder everywhere and devour everything?"
 02_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "So you're the ones pushing Yamato harder? Looking at your utterly defeated posture-hmm, makes sense."
 03_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Because of disgusting maggots like you, Blue Heaven has become Blue Hell."
 04_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Everything about [From.GetSpeciesAdj] is an enduring joke in our naval base."
 05_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "[Root.GetName] drove you out of your home port-we can drive you out of the galaxy too."
 06_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "The illegal structures on your warships are like dilapidated buildings untouched for fifteen years."
 07_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "A shipgirl like you would be fed to Galo in our port."
 08_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Yukikaze will bless you."
 09_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "That artifact in our shipgirl museum has the exact same pattern as your broken horn!"
 01_WSG_WAR_GREETING:0 "Thanks to your logistics department producing endless panties for us, you can now head to the dock and unload the one you're wearing."
 02_WSG_WAR_GREETING:0 "Your headmistress is nothing more than a beginner-level mob to us."
 03_WSG_WAR_GREETING:0 "Is the stage-clearing event starting? Let's see what loot we'll get this time."
 
 01_WSG_VASSAL_GREETING:0 "Our previous prejudice against [From.GetSpeciesAdj] was wrong-only under [From.GetRulerName]'s banner can we achieve true strength."
 02_WSG_VASSAL_GREETING:0 "[From.GetRulerName] is the Juggernaut of the universe; every citizen of [Root.GetName] should become their loyal servant."
 01_WSG_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL:0 "What trash are you?"
 02_WSG_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL:0 "You dare rule [Root.GetName]? You're merely despicable opportunists exploiting weakness."
 03_WSG_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL:0 "Once I finish spending on this fleet, you're all dead!"
 
 01_WSG_OVERLORD_GREETING:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj] has arrived? Conveniently, we have a resource site needing your personnel for an expedition."
 02_WSG_OVERLORD_GREETING:0 "If you dare resist, just look at what happened to past headmistresses."

 01_WSG_TO_WSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Comrades, greetings."
 02_WSG_TO_WSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Your [From.Capital.GetName] is as beautiful as our [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 03_WSG_TO_WSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "[Root.GetName] offers you our finest blessings!"
 04_WSG_TO_WSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Honored guest from [From.GetName]! Here is the finest tea and pastries-please enjoy."
 01_WSG_TO_WSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "I'm very busy now-feel free to make yourself comfortable."
 02_WSG_TO_WSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "Hi."
 01_WSG_TO_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "It's hard to decide whether you or deep-sea shipgirls are more despicable."
 02_WSG_TO_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Cunning and despicable creature-get out of my sight."
 03_WSG_TO_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Scoundrels from [From.GetName], how dare you even call yourselves shipgirls?"
 04_WSG_TO_WSG_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "The illegal structures on your warships are like dilapidated buildings untouched for fifteen years"
 01_WSG_TO_WSG_WAR_GREETING:0 "We will erase your existence-your descendants will learn from us how to become true shipgirls."
 02_WSG_TO_WSG_WAR_GREETING:0 "Just a realistic drill-ending as always with an SS victory for our side."
 03_WSG_TO_WSG_WAR_GREETING:0 "We shall win easily, as we have won countless battles before."
 
 01_WSG_TO_WSG_VASSAL_GREETING:0 "[From.GetName]! Please lead us!"
 02_WSG_TO_WSG_VASSAL_GREETING:0 "[From.GetRulerName]'s enemies are our enemies-we shall advance and retreat together."
 01_WSG_TO_WSG_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL:0 "Whenever we see the low efficiency of [From.GetName], we increasingly doubt whether you are still capable of ensuring our safety. No joke-perhaps we need to guarantee your safety instead?"
 02_WSG_TO_WSG_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL:0 "Only when [Root.GetName] achieves true freedom will our potential as shipgirls be fully unleashed. But under your dark rule, we see no light at all."
 03_WSG_TO_WSG_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL:0 "You are losing the qualification to lead [Root.GetName]."
 
 01_WSG_TO_WSG_OVERLORD_GREETING:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj] will, under our guidance, move toward shared prosperity."
 02_WSG_TO_WSG_OVERLORD_GREETING:0 "Under our leadership, 1+1 will inevitably be greater than 2."

 01_WSG_SPE_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Ah, dear sisters, welcome!"
 02_WSG_SPE_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Our beloved deep-sea sisters. Welcome to the naval base; head chef London has prepared delicious food for you."
 03_WSG_SPE_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "[Root.GetName] would never equate you with those deep-sea shipgirls who once harmed us."
 04_WSG_SPE_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Although many among us do not trust deep-sea shipgirls, I believe their attitudes will slowly change."
 01_WSG_SPE_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "You are not enemies from our history, yet you still make us uneasy."
 02_WSG_SPE_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "Greetings."
 01_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Indeed, deep-sea shipgirls are all the same-whether it's the ones we knew or your group, all equally terrible."
 02_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj], speak quickly if you have something to say."
 03_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "We've recently added you to our deep-sea encyclopedia, for easier targeting during firepower strikes."
 04_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Everything about [From.GetSpeciesAdj] is an enduring joke in our naval base."
 05_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "[Root.GetName] drove that previous batch of deep-sea forces out of our homeland-we can now drive your group out of the galaxy."
 06_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Don't think we're unaware of your absurd and ridiculous history. If I were a deep-sea shipgirl, I'd be ashamed and refuse to acknowledge you as kin."
 07_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Damn, this foul stench-don't you realize how terrible you smell?"
 08_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Leave here. Immediately. Now."
 09_WSG_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "After our military defeats you, the museum's collection will surely grow."
 01_WSG_SPE_WAR_GREETING:0 "Let's see how your batch of deep-sea shipgirls differs from the previous one."
 02_WSG_SPE_WAR_GREETING:0 "Are you really deep-sea shipgirls? You're far too different from the cold and efficient ones we remember."
 03_WSG_SPE_WAR_GREETING:0 "Come then, let us obtain different varieties of spoils."

 01_SH_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Sisters on the surface, I'm glad we can put aside hatred and get along peacefully... so could you please return my panties?"
 02_SH_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Dear sister, how have you been lately?"
 03_SH_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "This is the latest high-intensity chair developed by [Root.GetName], capable of withstanding thousands of tons of weight."
 04_SH_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Hope you can take good care of our shared home."
 01_SH_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "Hi."

 02_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "[Root.GetName] will strive unceasingly-we shall reclaim our [From.Capital.GetName]."
 03_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Getting heavily damaged outside port isn't serious-you should know I still have the recording of your A-point family bucket meal."
 04_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Everything about [From.GetSpeciesAdj] is an enduring joke in our naval base."
 05_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "The once beautiful [From.Capital.GetName] has been defiled by the despicable [From.GetName]."
 06_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "How exactly can we eliminate these greedy and despicable [From.GetName]?"
 07_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "For such a wretched naval base built by poop-tier admirals, having disgusting shipgirls like you is only natural."
 08_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Strange, you're actually online? Aren't [From.GetName]'s shipgirls supposed to be on expedition 24/7?"
 09_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "It's a shame your admiral didn't pull you into dark steel forging-it would've been a blessing for this galaxy."
 10_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "I still remember how you looked while eating the family bucket."
 01_SH_WAR_GREETING:0 "Hope you clean up [From.Capital.GetName] properly, so we can proceed with post-war reconstruction."
 02_SH_WAR_GREETING:0 "Surrender. Your grind level is simply not enough."
 03_SH_WAR_GREETING:0 "When I march into your capital, remind me that I'm not visiting a brothel."
 04_SH_WAR_GREETING:0 "I've placed a 1/3 random ditch at your doorstep."
 
 01_SH_VASSAL_GREETING:0 "[From.GetName] has proven to be better suited to lead [Root.GetName]. We shall offer our loyalty."
 02_SH_VASSAL_GREETING:0 "Whoever dares oppose [From.GetRulerName], we will smash its dog head first."
 01_SH_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL:0 "We suggest swapping leadership roles-the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] issues of weakness, laziness, bullying the weak, cowardice, filth, and feebleness will vanish."
 02_SH_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL:0 "[Root.GetName] will ultimately break free from its shackles."
 03_SH_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL:0 "The master of [From.Capital.GetName] will eventually be us."
 
 01_SH_OVERLORD_GREETING:0 "For the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] to reach our level, diligently studying the Yamato lord's 007 spirit is essential."
 02_SH_OVERLORD_GREETING:0 "[From.GetName], he who does not work overtime is worthy of death."

 02_SH_TO_SH_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "May [Root.GetName] and [From.GetName] remain ever valiant."
 03_SH_TO_SH_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "We can learn much from each other."
 04_SH_TO_SH_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "We shall together conquer this galaxy and rule over other civilizations."
 01_SH_TO_SH_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "What business do you have?"
 02_SH_TO_SH_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "Oh."
 01_SH_TO_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "To oppose us is an unwise choice."
 02_SH_TO_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Perhaps we need a duel to prove who truly embodies the abyss."
 03_SH_TO_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Coward from [From.GetName], dare you face me in a fair duel?"
 04_SH_TO_SH_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "If you continue down this deluded path, only annihilation awaits."
 01_SH_TO_SH_WAR_GREETING:0 "Come then, fight! Prove yourselves with blood and fire."
 02_SH_TO_SH_WAR_GREETING:0 "We will greet you with our fiercest artillery."
 03_SH_TO_SH_WAR_GREETING:0 "This war shall prove that [Root.GetName] is the true ruler destined to lead the abyss."

 01_SH_SPE_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "This is a high-intensity chair [Root.GetName] found within an ancient ruin-no Titanic Life could crush it!"
 02_SH_SPE_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Dear sisters, how have you been lately?"
 03_SH_SPE_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "In our memory, shipgirls do not exist, but we believe you are friendly."
 04_SH_SPE_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "I hope one day to visit the beautiful [From.Capital.GetName]."
 01_SH_SPE_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "We do not understand why you harbor such baseless hostility toward us."
 02_SH_SPE_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "Greetings."
 01_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Please do not impose your foolish views upon [Root.GetName]."
 02_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "[Root.GetName] is [Root.GetName]; others are others. Just because of similar appearances, unwarranted hatred arises? A spacefaring empire should possess basic discernment."
 03_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "If war is what you want, then let it be-nothing can stop the revival of [Root.GetName]."
 04_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Past, present, and future, [Root.GetName] remains a warlike people. Whether in games or reality, we always emerge victorious."
 05_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Because of your existence, I've had no peace today in the gaming community."
 06_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "A war simulation game specially customized for you has been completed. Our military greatly enjoys the pleasure of thoroughly beating you. We hope you have some sense and don't let this virtual game become reality."
 07_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "The time wasted talking to you would have been enough for me to play several games."
 08_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Oh, alright, that's it? If it's nothing important, please don't disturb us again."
 09_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "No time. Speak quickly."
 10_SH_SPE_UNFRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "You can try this game. The antagonist characters in it are very similar to you."
 01_SH_SPE_WAR_GREETING:0 "We've already beaten you soundly in virtual simulations. In reality, you'll be hit even harder and suffer far worse."
 02_SH_SPE_WAR_GREETING:0 "Surrender. We are already seasoned veterans."
 03_SH_SPE_WAR_GREETING:0 "In games, we must follow rules. In reality, we can act without restraint."
 04_SH_SPE_WAR_GREETING:0 "Surrender, and we may initiate the mercy protocol."
 
 01_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH_SPE:0 "You are among the most outstanding deep-sea kemono we've ever encountered."
 02_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH_SPE:0 "Our history in this galaxy is not long, so we do not know the history of your ancestors."
 03_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH_SPE:0 "[From.GetSpeciesName], my dear child, is there anything I can help you with?"
 04_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH_SPE:0 "[From.GetSpeciesName] has stepped out of the cradle. Never fall back again."
 05_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH_SPE:0 "[From.GetSpeciesName], our children, you still need to grow further, for threats can emerge at any moment."
 06_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH_SPE:0 "[wg_fallen_empire.GetName] will witness your revival."
 07_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH_SPE:0 "You are writing a new chapter in history. We believe in you."
 01_WG_FE_DISMISSIVE_SH_SPE:0 "If there's nothing else, please carry on."
 02_WG_FE_DISMISSIVE_SH_SPE:0 "Hello, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 01_WG_FE_ANGRY_SH_SPE:0 "Long indulgence in virtual games and luxurious living has made [From.GetSpeciesName] forget how to properly conduct themselves. We will teach you how to respect others."
 02_WG_FE_ANGRY_SH_SPE:0 "Remain humble, [From.GetSpeciesName]. Arrogance will make you fall once more."
 03_WG_FE_ANGRY_SH_SPE:0 "Before them, we are all but ants-but you will be destroyed much sooner."
 04_WG_FE_ANGRY_SH_SPE:0 "Mind your attitude, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
