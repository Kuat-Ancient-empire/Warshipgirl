 wg_lady.24.f.response:0 "What are you talking about? Organics are so disgusting! Even after a hundred thousand galactic eras, if I never find an object I like, I still won't be your w-w-wife... [whispers] ...not that it's completely out of the question."

 wg_lady_cloth01.25.desc.a:0 "Hey, §H[wsg_player_nickname.GetFleetName]§!, why are festivals only held on specific days? Aren't celebrations supposed to be fun?"
 wg_lady_cloth01.25.desc.b:0 "§H[wsg_player_nickname.GetFleetName]§!, do you believe in these gods? You don't? Then why do you worship them? Ceremony? I just can't understand organics..."
 wg_lady_cloth01.25.desc.c:0 "Those parade floats patrolling the streets look kind of fun! Huh, but I'm not really interested in performing on one... It's not because of that incident at all! I just don't like yelling!"
 wg_lady_cloth02.25.desc.a:0 "§H[wsg_player_nickname.GetFleetName]§!, is this festival meant for lovers?"
 wg_lady_cloth02.25.desc.b:0 "There are so many couples out on the streets today... Just like you and me... No, no, no-§H[wsg_player_nickname.GetFleetName]§! You heard nothing!"
 wg_lady_cloth02.25.desc.c:0 "Huh? What... Lover activities? I-I'm not going! We're definitely not lovers... probably... [quietly]"

 wg_lady_cloth01.26.desc.a:0 "§H[wsg_player_nickname.GetFleetName]§! Do you like slowly riding up high in these little carts? I could just fly you up instead. You like riding with me? Umm... I'm not happy or anything. Definitely not."
 wg_lady_cloth01.26.desc.b:0 "Roller coaster? Is it really that fun? I can flip through space dozens of times faster than this thing moves..."
 wg_lady_cloth01.26.desc.c:0 "Smoke... fireworks? I'm not mesmerized or anything-it's just that in space, you rarely see such pretty explosions. Usually when something explodes like that, it means something died..."
 wg_lady_cloth02.26.desc.a:0 "Organic, look at those flames over there-don't they look like roses?"
 wg_lady_cloth02.26.desc.b:0 "These annoying pests... always showing up to ruin things just when §H[wsg_player_nickname.GetFleetName]§! is around to keep me company... Huh!! You didn't hear anything!!"
 wg_lady_cloth02.26.desc.c:0 "§H[wsg_player_nickname.GetFleetName]§!, will you be free to hang out next year too? N-Not that I care! I just thought I'd take you to watch meteor showers in that neighboring star system or something..."

 wg_lady.26.c:0 "By the way, young miss, why did you suddenly wake up back then?"
 wg_lady.26.d:0 "Young miss... you've become a bit cuter lately."
 wg_lady.26.e:0 "Wife, good job in battle!"
 wg_lady.26.a.response:0 "§H[wsg_player_nickname.GetFleetName]§! You're so useless-barely finish off a boss and the homeland's already in chaos. Well, I can't let you suffer. I'll help you out a bit."
 wg_lady.26.b.response:0 "This time turning into Gao Damu? No no no, too big. Better turn into something about the same size as that dumb lawnmower."
 wg_lady.26.f.response:0 "It's just exploration! There's nowhere in the entire galaxy I can't go!"

 wg_lady.26.d.response:0 "I am, after all, the Contingency! But... not all organics are bad. I suppose completely formatting everything isn't the best idea, right?"
 wg_lady.26.e.response:0 "E-even if you keep praising me like that, I'm not... not happy or anything... dummy. Huh? You say... my face is red? Urusai urusai urusai!"

 wg_lady_cloth01.27.desc.b:0 "Although using the fire control system on a bottle-shooting carnival game feels kind of cheating... but I really want that plushie! §H[wsg_player_nickname.GetFleetName]§! You don't mind, right? Hehe~"

 wg_lady_cloth02.27.desc.c:0 "Xiao Jiling can fly, but it can't be more than ten meters away from me! S-so even if §H[wsg_player_nickname.GetFleetName]§! you carry it, you can't leave me behind!"

 wg_lady.27.c:0 "Young lady, have you thought of any tactics today?"
 wg_lady.27.d:0 "Young lady, if you can't hit them, why not try other tactics? For example..."
 wg_lady.27.e:0 "Young lady, isn't your look a bit strange?"
 wg_lady.27.a.response:0 "It's just a small thing, right? §H[wsg_player_nickname.GetFleetName]§! You're useless. When I get back, I'll delete all your files and break your pen in three minutes! Huh? That's not how you use this sentence?"
 wg_lady.27.b.response:0 "Stop dawdling! Since I'm already here, what's there to worry about? After assigning combat power, all that's left is to charge in. Dare doubt me... Hmph, you'll regret it."
 wg_lady.27.f.response:0 "Yay, time to travel~ Not a government-funded trip? Pfft, stingy."
 wg_lady.27.c.response:0 "Tactics? Just saturate the area with firepower? If that fails, do it a billion times more?"
 wg_lady.27.d.response:0 "Penetration and flanking, besiege points and strike reinforcements, disperse into small units? Sounds so advanced! I've learned something new today! Huh? I didn't compliment you or anything... Hmph! Pushing your luck, organic."
 wg_lady.27.e.response:0 "Hm? Isn't this Ultra-Massive Quadruped All-Terrain Final决战 Weapon Type One Giant Amphibious Laser Siege Machine totally cool? You ask where I learned about it... I don't know. My memory bank just has this data..."

 wg_lady_cloth01.28.desc.c:0 "Aren't there festivals like this in some places? Then are there no similar holidays? Huh, different names too? Wouldn't it be better if there were more days for everyone to play together? Organics sure have a lot of rules..."
 wg_lady_cloth02.28.desc.a:0 "What? Invite me to dinner? I'm not hungry-- Huh? Wait... feeding me? Why do you always think of such weird things, organic! Al-although... I don't mind... [quietly]"

 wg_lady.28.d.response:0 "Yes, yes! I found that huge bone the other day-it was amazing! Never thought organics could evolve such massive creatures on a gravity-bound World!"
 
 wg_lady.28.f.response:0 "No... nothing strange? Huh... um... (picks up the report and reads again) Well... see, nothing strange at all... Fine, fine, I just missed it, okay? How could anyone spot something so tiny? Are you Louis Pasteur or something?"
