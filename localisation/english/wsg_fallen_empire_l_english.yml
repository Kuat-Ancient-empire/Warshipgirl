 wg_fe.2.desc:0 "Hi, fellow [root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], it's great to meet you, although we can't quite remember how many shipgirl civilizations we've encountered by now.\n\nWe are §Y[wg_fallen_empire.GetName]§!, current inhabitants of this galaxy.\n\nLike you, we are also §Yshipgirls§!, so we're just dropping by to say hello."
 wg_fe.2.a:0 "Nice to meet you, [wg_fallen_empire.GetName]."
 wg_fe.2.b:0 "[wg_fallen_empire.GetName], we understand."
 wg_fe.2.c:0 "............ (Terminate Communication)"
 
 01_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_WSG:0 "Hello [From.GetSpeciesName], your civilization's data has been recorded. Though honestly, I'm not sure which number you are anymore... They were right after all."
 02_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_WSG:0 "Cherish the present. Cherish the place you call \"home.\""
 03_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_WSG:0 "Do you know about those deep-sea shipgirls in the south? They were already there when we first arrived, but they haven't responded to any of our hails..."
 04_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_WSG:0 "Why are the deep-sea shipgirls with us? My child, not all shipgirls and the Abyss must necessarily be mortal enemies."
 05_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_WSG:0 "[From.GetSpeciesName], my children, you must grow quickly. Perhaps not long from now we will face challenges again, for the nightmare that chases us will eventually find us once more."
 06_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_WSG:0 "Did we create you? No, no, no... You are all important to [wg_fallen_empire.GetName]. We love you as our own children."
 07_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_WSG:0 "You mentioned §YAdmiral§!? That sounds like a high-ranking position. Unfortunately, we have no such history. Not all shipgirl civilizations share the same origin-you must understand this."
 01_WG_FE_DISMISSIVE_WSG:0 "You are merely a Regular Blokkats among the countless civilizations we have encountered."
 02_WG_FE_DISMISSIVE_WSG:0 "Hello, [From.GetSpeciesName]. Goodbye."
 01_WG_FE_ANGRY_WSG:0 "You know, [From.GetSpeciesName], we've seen countless rebellious civilizations like yours in the past, but unfortunately most of them fell into ruin due to their arrogance."
 02_WG_FE_ANGRY_WSG:0 "Remain humble, [From.GetSpeciesName]; there is still much for you to learn."
 03_WG_FE_ANGRY_WSG:0 "Before the nightmare that chases us, we are all equal-though you will be destroyed far sooner."
 04_WG_FE_ANGRY_WSG:0 "You will pay the price for your ignorance and arrogance."
 01_WG_FE_WAR_GREETING_WSG:0 "Why oppose us?"
 02_WG_FE_WAR_GREETING_WSG:0 "Compared to them, you are utterly insignificant."
 03_WG_FE_WAR_GREETING_WSG:0 "Show your Strength to [wg_fallen_empire.GetName].\n\nWe hope you can prove capable of standing against them and halting the nightmare that pursues us."
 
 01_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH:0 "All deep-sea shipgirls are martial and powerful, aren't they? My dear [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 02_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH:0 "Why do deep-sea shipgirls stand alongside regular shipgirls? Since our civilization's birth, it has always been this way-shipgirls handle diplomacy, deep-sea handle military."
 03_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH:0 "[From.GetSpeciesName], my dear child, what is it?"
 04_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH:0 "Our past? I'm sorry, I cannot say more."
 05_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH:0 "[From.GetSpeciesName], my children, you must grow quickly. Perhaps not long from now we will face challenges again, for the nightmare that chases us will eventually find us once more."
 06_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH:0 "Did we create you? No, no, no... You are all important to [wg_fallen_empire.GetName]. We love you as our own children."
 07_WG_FE_PATRONIZING_SH:0 "Your [From.GetSpeciesName] fled from your homeworld... Ah, never mind-it just brought back some unpleasant memories."
 01_WG_FE_DISMISSIVE_SH:0 "If nothing else, please carry on."
 02_WG_FE_DISMISSIVE_SH:0 "Hello, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 01_WG_FE_ANGRY_SH:0 "[From.GetSpeciesName], there are many deep-sea civilizations stronger than you, but alas, great military power cannot compensate for ignorance."
 02_WG_FE_ANGRY_SH:0 "Stay humble, [From.GetSpeciesName]; you know absolutely nothing about the challenges that await you."
 03_WG_FE_ANGRY_SH:0 "Before them, we are all but ants-though you will perish far sooner."
 04_WG_FE_ANGRY_SH:0 "Mind your attitude, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 01_WG_FE_WAR_GREETING_SH:0 "Ah, how ignorant, how arrogant."
 02_WG_FE_WAR_GREETING_SH:0 "We have witnessed their true Strength, while you... are insignificant."
 03_WG_FE_WAR_GREETING_SH:0 "Prove yourselves to [wg_fallen_empire.GetName].\n\nProve that you can stop that nightmare."
 
 
 01_WG_FE_CUSTODIAL_WG:0 "Only by defeating the United fleet can we earn the right to survive."
 02_WG_FE_CUSTODIAL_WG:0 "Once, endless flight was the entirety of our civilization. But now, we have decided to face our fate. [Root.GetName], let us end this nightmare together."
 03_WG_FE_CUSTODIAL_WG:0 "[From.GetSpeciesName], my dear child, what is it?"
 04_WG_FE_CUSTODIAL_WG:0 "[wg_fallen_empire.GetName]'s Strength is not yet sufficient to oppose the United fleet, but if we cooperate with all our might, there is hope."
 05_WG_FE_CUSTODIAL_WG:0 "We will give everything we have to illuminate this galaxy."
 06_WG_FE_CUSTODIAL_WG:0 "For 9.5 million years, we have witnessed countless partings and deaths, the destruction of countless civilizations, the annihilation of countless galaxies. We wander through the void, seeking only that laughable and fleeting peace-but now, we will not retreat."
 07_WG_FE_CUSTODIAL_WG:0 "Do not abandon hope, [From.GetSpeciesName]; we will surely endure."
