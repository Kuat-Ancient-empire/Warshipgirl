 wg_origin.299.desc:0 "Through repeated combat banter and duel provocations, we learned this Sector uses a device to generate a [Soul-Repelling Dead Zone]. Within this energy field, we cannot manifest any psionic power-all forces gradually lose vitality until becoming lifeless husks, not even the Emperor T's Death Angels spared.\n\nIf we fail to destroy all Necrons in this Sector, they will construct anti-Unterraum matrices across other Worlds in the galaxy, permanently severing Unterraum's influence on reality.\n\nOur Battle Sisters were surrounded during planetary combat. When all believed defeat certain, \"Exorcist Saint Guardian\" Ephriel led a surprise assault-amidst hymns praising the Emperor, our ground forces ceased suffering negative effects from the Soul-Repelling Dead Zone!\n\nLoyal Sisterhood perfectly decapitated the enemy command and repelled all Necron forces. Seizing this moment of weakest zone influence, our fleet transmitted a distress signal to the Sacred Homeworld."

 wg_origin.300.desc:0 "Quintus of the Adeptus Mechanicus arrived at the Soul-Repelling Dead Zone with a group of tech-priests, bringing ancient relics-they seek to test whether these precious archeotech artifacts can counteract Necron technology. This research requires vast amounts of black stone as experimental material; we must dispatch fleets to protect Mechanicus excavation operations.\n\n[wg_nicron_country.GetName]'s threat persists-these vile xenos attacked again, attempting to halt our excavation."

 wg_origin.301.desc:0 "The Necron \"Silent King Szarekh\" claims we understand nothing of honor, trampling upon offered respect; they will show us no mercy and use every destructive weapon to annihilate us.\n\nThey now freely employ any warfare technology. While some of our conventional weapons become ineffective in this Sector, our tech-priests eagerly anticipate reclaiming memories of the Dark Age, believing their forbidden tech will not fall short."

 wg_origin.305.a.desc:0 "Our great forces suffered unforeseen setbacks on [fromfrom.GetName]; we must swiftly regroup-absolutely not allowing these space xenos a single minute of triumph.\n\nUnder the Emperor's protection, our Space Marines have spontaneously deployed to the frontlines, resisting these unforgivable space xenos."
 wg_origin.305.b.desc:0 "Our great forces suffered another unforeseen setback on [fromfrom.GetName]-this is unusual.

 wg_origin.302.desc:0 "As [fromfrom.GetName] neared collapse, two Corvette fleets led by Mechanicus Adepts watched the nearly hopeless ground situation and the heavily fortified Necron fleet in orbit, feeling helpless.\n\nThey activated their concealed Adept's Wondrous Gadget-a humble device that exploded in orbit around [fromfrom.GetName].\n\nThis echo from the ancient Dark Age annihilated numerous planetary structures and all nearby forces indiscriminately, after which the Mechanicus Adepts quietly fled."

 wg_origin.303.name:0 "Necron's Counterattack"
 wg_origin.303.desc:0 "The actions of the Mechanicus Adepts enraged the Necron technicians on [from.GetName], who unleashed incomprehensible technological energy. After entering our forces, many units defected or turned on each other. Though the arrival of Imperial Knights stabilized the precarious battlefield, the overseeing Mechanicus Adept could not tolerate such xeno humiliation and activated a mysterious secret weapon of unknown origin.\n\nBut before it could fulfill its intended function, it transformed into an ever-expanding, profound and fantastical Black Hole. This Black Hole consumed one-third of [from.GetName]'s mass and all forces upon it before finally halting. Meanwhile, in Zane's orbit, Necron technicians dragged a dwarf star into our fleet, inflicting heavy losses.\n\nOur fleet's desperate counterattack destroyed the dwarf star's control mechanism-uncontrolled, the star erupted instantly, destroying all fleets and [from.GetName]."

 wg_origin.304.desc:0 "With Imperial forces destroying all black obelisks, the Soul-Repelling Dead Zone ceased functioning. At the moment the last obelisk fell, all Necron forces translocated away-though a few heretics remained, mopping-up forces will eliminate them in due time.\n\nThe enemies we faced were merely protective forces for their experimental trials-many more combat units never appeared on the battlefield. Whether the Necrons harbor further plans, we must prepare for their return."
