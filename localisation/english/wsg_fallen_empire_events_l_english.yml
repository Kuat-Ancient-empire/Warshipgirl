wg_fe.20.desc:0 "Has it already come to this time?\n...My children, you are not yet §Ypowerful§! enough. §YThey§! are coming soon, and at this rate, it won't do. Even if it means risking violation of non-interference protocols, you must grow stronger-dozens of times stronger than us-only then will you stand a chance against them."
wg_fe.20.a:0 "§YThey§!... Who are they?"
wg_fe.20.a.response:0 "Remember this name: §RCombined Fleet§!! They are the scourge surpassing all civilizations, our natural nemesis, the very embodiment of disaster! Wherever they go, nothing remains-they reduce everything to nothingness!"
wg_fe.20.b:0 "Can we possibly defeat such a powerful enemy?"
wg_fe.20.b.response:0 "The universe is boundless, and many civilizations still resist. Some have organized into factions; we chose to flee. As the saying goes, as long as the green hills remain, there's no need to worry about firewood. Our duty is to preserve as many of our kin as possible-including you. But we won't force you to leave. The choice is yours alone."
wg_fe.20.b.response2:0 "There is hope for you-I see it in you. There is still some time before they arrive. My child, you must grow strong quickly. You may choose to leave with us, but we cannot take all of you. Thus, we shall protect you until the very end-though without sufficiently large guns, all of this is meaningless."
wg_fe.20.c:0 "We will stay behind. We will become infinitely powerful and rise to fight them!"
wg_fe.20.c.response:0 "Since your decision is made, all that remains is for us to grant you the outline of this §Gdark matter technology§!. It will be a major hurdle on your scientific path. Once you overcome it, you will be able to create more powerful weapons and ships to resist them."
wg_fe.20.c.response2:0 "Very well. These dark matter technologies can now rest safely in your hands-it will be the final hurdle on your scientific journey. With dark matter, you will forge even mightier weapons to oppose them. Grow strong, my child, §Yyou must and will bear the responsibility of defending the galaxy.§!"
wg_fe.20.d:0 "Fine. We shall become powerful-powerful enough to instill fear and despair in all who face us."
wg_fe.20.d.response:0 "Youth is truly wonderful... [root.GetName], then try your best-to grow strong enough to rival them. Go, attempt to eradicate the nightmare that has haunted us for millennia. Then, even if we perish, the burden we've carried for millions of years may finally be laid down."
wg_fe.20.e:0 "Take some of our sisters with you. We will stay here and fight to the very end!"
wg_fe.20.e.response:0 "Since your resolve is firm, we will carry your sisters forward no matter what-that is the only promise we can make. Also, we gift you this outline of §Gdark matter technology§!. It will be a great challenge on your scientific path. Overcome it, and you will forge stronger weapons and ships to resist them."
wg_fe.20.e.tooltip:0 "One random Pop from [wg_fe_task_planet.GetName] will be taken to [wg_fallen_empire.GetName]."

# 觉醒

wg_fe.23.desc:0 "To all sisters of [root.GetName], fellow kin, all Shipgirls and Abyssal Vessels: during our time together, we have witnessed the beauty here, seen your unwavering determination to resist till the end. We regret and grow weary of our past life hiding in shadows. Every citizen of [wg_fallen_empire.GetName] has unanimously decided-we shall stand with you in this galaxy, never retreating, fighting to the last soldier and last ship!"
wg_fe.23.a:0 "(Continuous applause and cheers)"

wg_fe.26.desc:0 "They're coming, §RThey are coming§!-sisters of [root.GetName], my children, we can no longer remain here! We are truly sorry, but we must depart. Please take care! May we meet again someday!\n\nBefore we go, we leave this fleet to you-may it protect you, even if just a little, from those demons."
wg_fe.26.a:0 "It seems they have made their decision."
wg_fe.26.b:0 "A pitiful group..."
wg_fe.26.c:0 "Leave, remnants of a bygone era. Never let me see you again!"
wg_fe.28.name:0 "Departure"
wg_fe.28.desc:0 "This tenant, who 'temporarily' resided in the galaxy for tens of thousands of years, has set off once more. Her dwelling has been left spotless. Buildings once bustling with activity now stand utterly deserted."
wg_fe.28.a:0 "Will we ever meet them again somewhere?"
wg_fe.28.b:0 "He who has departed shall fulfill his mission."
wg_fe.28.c:0 "Excellent. Everything they left behind is now ours."
wg_fe.29.name:0 "Ashes Extinguished"
wg_fe.29.desc:0 "Not long ago, our scientists confirmed a shocking fact: the reclusive and mysterious AE §Y§Dream Ashes§! has suddenly vanished. Everything happened so abruptly that no one could immediately grasp its meaning. Whether their departure brings fortune or misfortune, none of us can say."
wg_fe.31.desc:0 "We won... I can't believe it...\nWe survived... It seems we still have another task ahead. You ask what task? Probably heading to the next galaxy to help other children. (Laughs)\nAfter all, we've grown accustomed to this life. Suddenly settling down would feel unnatural. I hope we meet again somewhere."
wg_fe.31.a:0 "Fair winds,前辈们."
wg_fe.31.b:0 "... (ending communication)"

wg_fe.110.a:0 "Wait, did I hear that right? Aren't you the AE mothers? Asking us to fix a gaming console?"
wg_fe.110.a.response:0 "This gaming console was acquired from native Shipgirl civilizations in another galaxy. Though its technology is primitive, sometimes these things are mysteriously complex. We've even tried repairing it with nanotechnology, but without original blueprints, problems persist. The manufacturing process resembles yours-we thought you might have a solution."
wg_fe.110.b:0 "Alright, we'll give it a try."
wg_fe.110.c:0 "You flatter us too much. If you yourselves can't repair this console, there's no way we could."

wg_fe.111.title:0 "Repair Failed"

wg_fe.111.desc_2:0 "Although we've never seen this type of gaming console before, and the technology it uses is quite ancient and tricky, it was no difficult task for our engineers-they fixed the console in no time."
wg_fe.111.a:0 "How about finding an Atomic Age native civilization to see if they have any solutions?"
wg_fe.111.b:0 "Shall we ask the curator?"
wg_fe.111.c:0 "Shall we ask the collector merchant?"
wg_fe.111.d:0 "What if I just smash it a bit to see what happens?"

wg_fe.112.desc.a:0 "We dispatched several agents, disguising them as residents of the planet and declaring themselves as tourists. Thus, they began asking locals about shops that could repair gaming consoles. After days of searching, we narrowed down several stores and inquired about repairing the console. Surprisingly, one shop owner actually had spare hardware parts for this model and sold them to us at a low price."
wg_fe.112.a:0 "We're so lucky."
wg_fe.112.desc.b:0 "We dispatched several agents, disguising them as residents of the planet and declaring themselves as tourists. Thus, they began asking locals about shops that could repair gaming consoles. After days of searching, we narrowed down several stores and inquired about repairing the console. Unfortunately, none of the shop owners claimed to have the ability to repair this gaming console."
wg_fe.113.desc:0 "A gaming console? Are you joking, guest? Did you come all the way here for this?"
wg_fe.113.a:0 "This gaming console is greatly favored by our [root.GetRulerTitle]. We hope you can find a way to repair it."
wg_fe.113.a.response:0 "I see... While this does waste my precious time, your payment is simply too generous to refuse. Fine, we'll repair it for you immediately."
wg_fe.113.b:0 "I'm telling you again-I'm not joking!"
wg_fe.113.b.response:0 "Sigh... Something like this should be repairable even by you. Please don't waste my time, guest."
wg_fe.114.title:0 "Mysterious Old-School Gaming Console"
wg_fe.114.desc:0 "As expected, the curator's vast database contained plenty of information about this old-style gaming console. They repaired it quickly-though the repair fee seems rather expensive..."
wg_fe.114.a:0 "As long as it works, let's take it back to the Fallen Empire!"
wg_fe.115.desc:0 "A gaming console? Your interests are quite... unusual, guest?"
wg_fe.115.a:0 "Our [root.GetRulerTitle] holds this gaming console in high regard. I beg you, please help us."
wg_fe.115.a.response:0 "Oh, I see. Though I'm somewhat reluctant, the amount you're offering is simply too generous. Let me check if I have any stock left."
wg_fe.115.b:0 "Yes... So, could you please help us with this?"
wg_fe.115.b.response:0 "Guest... we definitely won't carry such obscure goods. Please seek someone else."
wg_fe.116.title:0 "Another gaming console"
wg_fe.116.desc:0 "After some searching by the merchant, they pulled out several still-functional gaming consoles from an old warehouse-one of which was identical in model to the one we possess."
wg_fe.116.a:0 "It's not the original one, which feels a bit off... but it should be fine, right?"
wg_fe.117.title:0 "Ork-Style Repair Method"

wg_fe.118.a:0 "Here you go, piece of cake."
wg_fe.118.response:0 "Oh, that's wonderful! Thank you, [Root.GetName]! By the way, I have a really fun game here-I'll give everyone a free copy as a reward!"
wg_fe.119.title:0 "Half-Life 3"
wg_fe.119.desc:0 "[wg_fallen_empire.GetName] shared with us a game called §YHalf-Life 3§! from another galaxy. This game from the Shipgirl Fallen Empire quickly sparked a gaming craze among the populace."
wg_fe.119.a:0 "If everyone likes it, that's excellent."
