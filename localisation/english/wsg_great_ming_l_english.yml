 wg_great_ming.131.desc:"Storm approaches-have you prepared yourselves?\nThe Imperial Astronomical Bureau has observed the extinguishing of starlight in neighboring star systems. The threat \"Above the Stars\" draws near. The Emperor has ordered the Empire into full combat readiness.\nAdditionally, due to the approaching war, the Emperor grants you temporary exemption from tribute obligations, allowing full resource consolidation for war preparations."
 wg_great_ming.131.a:"Storm approaches..."
 wg_great_ming.132.desc:"They have come. According to intercepted intelligence from the Jinyiwei, they call themselves the \"United Fleet,\" and seek to exterminate all lifeforms in the galaxy-including those of their own race, such as ourselves.\n\nWe have no retreat. We have no defenses left...\nThe Son of Heaven guards the nation's gate. The King dies for his realm.\nJoin me upon the glorious battlefield!"
 wg_great_ming.132.a:"By this royal authority, let conquest be reborn!"
 wg_great_ming.133.desc:"Incredible-you truly defeated the United Fleet.\nThe Emperor is currently performing ancestral rites in the Imperial Temple and cannot personally attend to you at this moment.\nHowever, He has issued orders: in recognition of your great victory over the United Fleet, you are hereby granted the exceptional privilege of marrying not one, but two Imperial Princesses. Such a union-two Great Ming princesses serving one consort-is unprecedented in history.\nFurthermore, the Emperor graciously permits you to exit the Imperial tributary system without penalty. You may still contact us afterward to exchange resources if desired, though you may also choose to remain.\nLastly, congratulations once again on defeating the United Fleet. This time, my congratulations are offered in my personal capacity."
