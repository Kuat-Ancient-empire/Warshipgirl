This vessel was deployed into combat after only minimal command updates were issued to its AI, with no human oversight. The lack of maintenance and insufficient understanding of its design caused the ship's AI to fail during an update attempt, trapping it in a fatal reboot loop and rendering the vessel completely inoperative.\nOur electronic warfare specialists suggest that exploiting this same bug within our own electronic countermeasure systems could allow us to disrupt the Great Khan's fleet, shifting the balance of power in our favor."
