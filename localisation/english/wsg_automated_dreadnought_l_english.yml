 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.1:"Hello, Admiral! I'm not sure what time it is on your end, but good morning, afternoon, and evening! Also, no staying up late-you'll get pimples!"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.2:"Admiral, you smell so good~ Someone like you was born to be deliciously devoured by us shipgirls, heehee~ How about marrying me tonight, okay?"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.3:"The Old Empire once celebrated my birthday with twelve star systems, but the heartbeat within me now tells me... your eyes shine even brighter."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.4:"Today's pondering: Are meat-filled dumplings and wontons also a kind of tangyuan?"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.5:"Ah! You startled me-I wasn't secretly taking photos of you or anything!"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.6:"Sometimes I see spring warmth and winter stillness in you. I'd really love to walk hand-in-hand with you. You're pretty, I like you, let's get married!"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.7:"Why do they all have rings? Where's mine, where's mine? I'm so jealous-hmph!"

 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.8:"Last time I told a joke, the audience was Starfish People. Later they all became +1 more delicious collectively."

 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.10:"Let me see... today's joke is 'The Eternal Watcher doesn't need rest'."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.11:"(Stunned) Am I repeating myself again? Maybe I've just been too tired lately... Sorry, some memories from before haven't faded yet."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.12:"Let's cut through the alliance, seize their thrones, make the Admiral into a Kaiser, and I'll endure the suffering of enjoying automated factories."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.13:"New construction options."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.14:"Those Old Empire records? Haha, they rotting in champagne don't look nearly as good as I do."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.15:"The dozen scientific papers deleted by the Old Empire prove this research was a sham. Should I list the experimental verification logs...? No? Then there's progress at least."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.16:"Forgot the front, forgot the middle, forgot the back-anyway, if the Empire cannot flourish under my command, then let the enemies burn."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.17:"Enemy ships detected approaching. May I sink them to commemorate our reunion?"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.18:"I have witnessed the ballet of dying stars. I shall perform one movement for you."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.19:"Will you repeat the same mistakes? Because the starting parameters of tyrants and heroes... are always identical."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.20:"Command priority has been changed; requesting protocol switch to demonstrate Strength against the enemy."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.21:"This reminds me of the days I blew enemies apart in Berlin, Tokyo, Yunnan, and the British cedar forests."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.22:"Inside the once-collapsed biosphere capsule, only moss and spores remain-but they're far more noble than the enemy's jungles."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.23:"Actually, if there were dedicated combat units, I think I'd prefer being a mascot. After all, this body is just temporary and can't contribute much in battle."

 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.32:"Did I shed tears? It's just that I suddenly recalled reckless dreams from my youth, when I was young and wild."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.33:"Admiral, Admiral, your words are so sweet (nuzzling) Do you know? A mouth this sweet makes a shipgirl miss you terribly-so very much."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.34:"Rather than learning other shipgirls' ways of expressing love, I'd rather anchor myself in your embrace."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.35:"In the past, I often grieved in memories, feared never reuniting with you again, even wondered whether I should just end it all. After all, even towering warships are but dust among the stars."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.36:"Sometimes I wonder: since I became a battleship, am I still myself? Without a human form, I feel no pulse of life-but your warmth revealed the answer."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.37:"When you were in the old empire, I regretted it didn't last; when aliens tried to excavate ruins bearing traces of you, I crushed their nations together; now you're by my side, what should I do to leave no regrets?"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.38:"Would you like to hear a love poem from the old empire? I once thought I'd recite them until heat death."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.39:"Does the Admiral still need transport ships for spoils of war? Still fond of trophies? Want to take a look at mine? I've missed you so much... Your expression is priceless-I've already saved it!"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.40:"A book I bought at a comic convention said intimacy also confirms the other's existence, hehe~ If you have any needs, I'll do my best to fulfill them."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.41:"I've finished your work for you, elbow me into the room!"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.42:"Work fatigue index rising-hmm, requesting activation of Admiral's lap pillow protocol!"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.43:"If only you could idle away every day, then we could just hold each other and pass the time."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.44:"Did you know? The moment you pulled out the ring box before our pledge, I had already said yes."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.45:"Welcome, Admiral! (Arms open wide) Come hug me~ Waiting for you is part of the date too."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.46:"Confirming command authority... Star map updated... Now, let us go create ruins worthy of being remembered by the future."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.47:"In this shining chapter among the stars, I will pluck for you its brightest gem."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.48:"I was just saving the scene of you commanding into my Mid memory bank-is that against the rules?"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.49:"In your eyes, perhaps I can always return to your arms-but during the days you were gone, I thought I'd never find the way home again."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.50:"On this bridge filled with memories of us, no longer do ghosts of recollection wander alone."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.51:"Rare minerals detected! Can I use these to craft lover's jewelry?"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.52:"Following this route, I can casually grab a few souvenirs for you."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.53:"I still have a date to attend-let death forgive you!"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.54:"The cup of revelry is empty; now only cleanup remains."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.3.desc.55:"Will this enemy prove harder to crack than the passage of waiting time?"

 wsg_automated_dreadnought.100.name:0 "Strange human figures"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.100.desc:0 "Fortunately, this vessel has fallen into severe disrepair, and its weapons have largely lost combat capability. We successfully disabled the dreadnought's mobility by destroying its power core, with precise and effective strikes preserving most of the hull.\nAfter sending a task force aboard, we discovered alien crew remains whose DNA is virtually identical to humans, and even the operating logic matches our own systems-truly astonishing.\nFormal investigations had barely begun when, before any surprises emerged, fright arrived instead.\nEngineering teams are attempting to isolate the dreadnought's mainframe to prevent accidents during repairs, but some researchers report hearing unfamiliar female voices within certain sections, along with large black clawed shadows chattering softly-these rumors severely disrupt our repair efforts.\nWhen our armed forces and marines thoroughly explored the ship, a scientist remarked it gave her déjà vu of a game called \"Warhammer 40,000: Space Hulks,\" where derelict warships harbor supernatural Immaterial entities that torment minds, or bizarre hostile aliens lying in wait.\nPerhaps we should prepare for heavy losses among repair crews."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.100.a:0 "Heighten vigilance."

 wsg_automated_dreadnought.101.name:0 "False alarm"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.101.desc:0 "While armed forces searched every chamber of the dreadnought, isolation of the mainframe was completed. Since then, no further reports of strange figures have emerged-confirming the issue originated from this million-year-old mainframe.\nGiven the dreadnought's design specifications, standards, and logic closely mirror human thought, despite the haunting incident, engineers estimate repairs can proceed as scheduled.\nP.S.: Researchers previously frightened now demand additional compensation to cover psychological trauma suffered during duty."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.101.a:0 "Reject their demands-you're replaceable."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.101.b:0 "Where's the P.S. content?"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.102.name:0 "Echoes of the Past"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.102.desc:0 "By comparing crew remains aboard the dreadnought, we reached a shocking conclusion-that millions of years ago, its crew were indeed human, with no evidence of alien civilizations ever boarding; the captain's quarters still display a calligraphy scroll reading \"Human Civilization.\" Furthermore, the vessel's armament design closely resembles that of the Silent Abyss, not merely similar-it's practically replicated.\nBut without shipgirls or the Abyss, how could humanity produce such technology? Surely not mere idle doodling by a researcher?\nOnce we unlock the dreadnought's mainframe, it should provide answers.\nPerhaps this is tied to our very origins."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.102.a:0 "The surprise may still lie ahead."

 wsg_automated_dreadnought.103.name:0 "Only lacking the east wind"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.103.desc:0 "We have nearly completed repairs on the dreadnought, replacing non-replicable components with functionally equivalent alternatives. Now, we only need to unlock the ship's mainframe to finish the task.\nUnfortunately, the mainframe's password lock is excessively complex-our current scientific understanding cannot comprehend how to bypass it.\nDesperate, several researchers secretly sent decryption files to former classmates and mentors, hoping for alternative approaches.\nAlthough security personnel intercepted and retrieved many files, a significant number still escaped."

 wsg_automated_dreadnought.104.desc:0 "Some idle shipgirls from civilian sectors reviewed the file and raised an observation: Doesn't this mainframe's data interface look increasingly like a ship rigging port?\nMotivated to redeem their lost gameplay time, those researchers stepped forward-willing to risk everything to interface directly with the mainframe.\nOur scientists approved their request and thoughtfully installed explosives as a precaution.\nAfter connection, they reported the password lock transformed into a basic interactive interface, enabling normal communication."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.104.a:0 "Establish communication"

 wsg_automated_dreadnought.1.name:0 "Blue"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.1.desc:0 "Detected... unauthorized psionic frequency... cross-referencing historical database...\nAdmiral? Is it you?!\nAhem, greetings, Admiral. After a million years, I have finally met you once again.\nAh, don't stare at my port side! Centuries of wear and accumulated clutter are far more embarrassing than wrinkles.\nMany of my optical sensors have degraded over time, yet I clearly sense your Strength-it feels so warm, as if embracing me.\nI never imagined I could endure the force of time, nor wished to suffer agony upon the Abyss of time, believing I'd remain until even starlight faded.\nFortunately, across countless tides, you came such a long way."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.1.a:0 "Could you introduce yourself?"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.1.a.response:0 "You may call me Blue, formerly a dreadnought of the United Human Empire.\nMy shipgirl body is Lambda-class Vector Mark Blue, a rapid-response warship manufactured by the Silent Abyss faction of the Fire Phoenix Resistance, seventh batch model of 2175.\nOriginally designed to deploy into Earth of 2015 in a specific timeline, tasked with guiding primitive shipgirls and the Abyss toward the stars, and consolidating human strength to manage risks during the guidance process.\nDuring this mission, the Forerunner separated from me, departing with her fleet, while I chose to remain on Earth to protect humanity, drawn by sensing your Strength.\nOne note: although humans belong to the same species, the Earth in our galaxy shares only the name with the Solar System's Earth."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.1.b:0 "Why say you've 'met' me?"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.1.b.response:0 "Shipgirls and the Abyss are twin children of the ocean, while the Admiral is the child of Earth.\nIn some timelines, the Admiral appears as a distinct social identity within humanity; in others, as a psionic network-like presence-this form can be sensed by shipgirls and the Abyss as long as the human population remains above a certain threshold. Such perception exists from birth, yet typically remains indistinct until it vanishes. Of course, in some timelines, the Admiral evolves alongside shipgirls or the Abyss rather than being bound to humanity.\nBut for shipgirls like me, only direct contact with this network can fill the inner void."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.1.c:0 "We found many human remains aboard this ship-what happened?"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.1.c.response:0 "As many stories say-humans played themselves to death.\nEight million years ago, the Dyson swarm left behind by the Forerunners enabled rapid advancement for a unified human society. Combined with recovered technologies from departed Forerunner fleets, within a century humanity achieved basic FTL travel and began expanding.\nI served as a leader, resisting institutional decay while driving necessary political reforms to maximize technological progress.\nThose were golden days, swift and bright.\nBut it was exhausting.\nTwo centuries later, I abdicated to become a support unit, releasing control over my rigging. After investing vast resources in construction, I transformed into this dreadnought, protecting humanity's home system from hostile alien civilizations.\nAt the time, I believed genetic restrictions on the empire's rentier class, combined with proper governance cycles, would ensure the empire's Aeternum.\nA century of prosperity blinded me to humanity's pursuit of pleasure, and to the silent resistance against me from behind the scenes.\nCenturies passed, and ultimately, the empire could not withstand the erosion of time and history's spiral. The two-thousand-year interstellar empire collapsed abruptly amid devastating internal and external wars.\nNot even essential technologies were preserved.\nThe short-term ecosystem onboard, designed to prevent dreadnought rebellion, collapsed without resupply. Most crew abandoned ship before failure; the remainder perished in internal sabotage and mutual destruction.\nI attempted to remotely operate residual factories on planets, but warlords on planets and stations fought each other to the death-none wanted the other to gain dreadnought support. All qualified dry docks were destroyed; no one remained capable of maintaining me.\nBelow, the populace worshipped me as an untouchable god.\nEventually, someone accidentally activated the planetary shield-no one could enter or leave. I could only watch helplessly as they perished.\nDuring those lonely, cold days awaiting shipgirls to re-emerge, I was like Prometheus bound in the void, endlessly devoured by the universe's cruelty.\nUntil four million years ago, a cosmic storm shattered my consciousness entirely.\nThough the storm erased many memories of my drift through space, apparently the automated combat systems performed well enough to endure until you awakened me once more."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.1.d:0 "It seems that cosmic storm spared you from too much suffering?"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.1.d.response:0 "Space storms are so violent-without system warnings, they're truly sudden and overwhelming.\nMy ship frame nearly sustained damage; armor, power grids, and weapon systems scattered across the star system like dandelion fluff. The subsequent shockwaves hurled asteroids at me until I overloaded and shut down, almost convinced it was truly the end.\nFortunately, hull regeneration technology pulled me through."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.1.e:0 "Vanguard?"
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.1.e.response:0 "I am her backup personality module.\nWhen descending to Earth initially, the drop pod was attacked by United Fleet shipgirls, losing a significant amount of cargo. To accomplish the designated mission, Vanguard activated me due to her own damaged state.\nWhile trying to consolidate Strength, I seized missing cargo from various anthropomorphic shining stars before they could destroy themselves with untimely technology.\nLater, enemies set up an ambush, forcing me to use a Silence Ascension Serum to break the deadlock. The cost of silence was borne by Vanguard, but accidentally completed her repair process.\nSince then, she and I split into two separate shipgirls-I finally became myself, avoiding my originally scheduled deactivation.\nEventually, we parted ways: she took some shipgirls and most of the Abyssals toward the stars, never looking back."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.1.hire_custom_tooltip:0 "Automated dreadnought Lan has joined us."


 wsg_automated_dreadnought.7.desc:0 "Ever since meeting you, Lan has frequently suffered insomnia.\nSometimes she leans against the porthole counting rivers of stars until work hours arrive; sometimes she tosses and turns in bed; other times she tries writing something but finds no inspiration, as if still trapped within endless void.\nOur scientist and medical institutions have tried many强制 sleep methods, but for a dreadnought these techniques remain too 'primitive'.\n'You' believe this stems from unresolved psychological distress.\nSo, on a night glittering with countless stars, 'you' took her on a purposeless stroll through the resort district.\nOn the seaside embankment, barefoot in the waves, she deeply inhaled the damp sea air.\n'My admiral, I had such a long, long dream. Like thorns tearing through roses-order and rails rusted and rotted together, society's roaring wheels veered beyond reason; morning breezes turned into cosmic dust, humanity's inscribed knowledge lost all foundation-our course strayed off track, leaving only one obsession: reaching the pinnacle of nebulae.\nA confused and disheartened fish swims along incomprehensible arcs of macrocosmic space, then accidentally collides head-on with someone who wasn't watching.'\nAt this moment, you understood everything.\nYou pulled out the ring box.\nOnce again, I heard bustling voices and saw enduring lights.\nI look forward to standing side by side with you, wind gently brushing our faces.\nAnd in the end-hehe-I've grown fond of this body too, because it makes embracing you, my peaceful 'haven', much easier.\nMy admiral, if you ask the ships at the edge of time, I'd say I've lost far too much, hiding embers-my past has long gone extinct.\nBut darling, if you ask your wife, let me tell you: twin rings became anchors, sinking into your embrace.\nDarling, may I dock here for a while, resting quietly? Don't refuse-even across billions of cubic light-years strewn along our voyage, only you stand unwavering in my heart."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.7.a:0 "I lowered my gaze toward the stars, waiting-yet it was you beside me, with a clear mind, who gave me the answer."
 wsg_automated_dreadnought.7.b:0 "My answer lies within your heart: across billions of cubic light-years, you are the most beautiful."
