About the information...we'd instead like to believe it's a prank from a random naughty guy if we don't have absolute confidence in the quantum shielding.\n\nDr. Yubari points out that it's really lucky to catch signals from §Yother spacetime branches§!. In the quantum world, even light may not transmit through a straight line, and the tunnel itself is a wrap of rules composed of a random arrangement of imaginary numbers at a given instant. It is very unstable, any subtle perturbations will cause significant change to its property-maybe in the next second, and this signal will disappear into the void beyond where the light cone can reach...Now the most crucial problem is if we don't take advantage of the current singularity to lock the space-time phase with each other as soon as possible, we may not able to contact them again until our spacetime goes to heat silence.\n\nAnd unluckily, our archaeology team at [Root.Capital.GetName] seems to have found a large number of §YAbyssal relics§! one after another during the excavation process. They are also keen to have Dr. Yubari's team help analyze these fragile items as soon as possible, which are restless at the atomic level because we have broken the static force field that can be applied to the atomic nucleus during excavation...Even more outrageous, those Abyssal relics are primarily composed of highly radioactive material with a very short half-life period.
