Moreover, the architectural style differs entirely from the outer sections. The control equipment indicates the original operators were soft-bodied marine organisms.

The first built the innermost structure; the second expanded and redesigned it, but due to excessive resource investment and slow progress, ultimately abandoned the project; the third-and most recent-civilization, responsible for the outermost shell, conducted a second expansion and reconstruction based on the predecessors' work. However, due to enormous temporal gaps and significant physiological differences between species, they made modifications and chose to treat the predecessors' achievements as encapsulated code, untouched.
