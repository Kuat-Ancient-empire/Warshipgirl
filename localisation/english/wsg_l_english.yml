 r_wg_god_desc:0 "Zhang Haibao's Biography\n\nHaibao is a mold maker, surnamed Zhang. His age is unknown, but he has enormous breasts. The person depicted is Haibao, and the artist is still unknown. Haibao is a ship commander, with the heart of a giant, and his V-shaped logo is prominent, leading to the world calling his army the "Union."\nHaibao is slow to update in group chats, showing signs of decline. During collaborations, he slacks off again, angering the group members. Haibao says: "The strength of the Union fleet is nothing to fear. The Abyssal Fleet is good at fighting, so we weaken it; the ship girls are lazy, so we weaken them; annihilation and isolation are also problematic, so we weaken them too!" The group is furious, fearing Haibao's actions towards his "wife," but they cannot speak out. However, Haibao then says: "Are those EDDYs kind?" The anger intensifies.\nA content creator once wrote a poem, using evil methods to destroy the Union army; Haibao saw this and therefore weakened it. Now, the resistance is weak, and the Union is growing stronger, all thanks to Zhang Haibao's actions; the evil content creator also bears responsibility.\nAlthough Haibao acts alone, countless others have joined the Union, replying: "I admire Haibao's appearance!" VV is barren and cannot garner public support or win popular hearts. Zhang Zhihao, comparable to Mei, surpasses even the secretary; his swaying gait is widely known. Zhang Zhijun, having broken through the fortress at Jingmen, shattered the defenses and destroyed the fleet; his advance was unstoppable. By coercing them with threats and seducing them with beauty, the alliance grows stronger, and the resistance against Japan will surely subside."
